vii</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> repeating such known facts
of Congreve&rsquo;s life as seem agreeable to the present
occasion, and before attempting (with the courage of one&rsquo;s
office) to indicate with truth what manner of man he was, and
what are the varying qualities of his four comedies, it seems
well to discuss and have done with two questions, obviously
pertinent indeed, but of a wider scope than the works of any one
writer.</p>
<p>The first is a stupid question, which may be happily dismissed
with brief ceremony.&nbsp; Grossness of language&mdash;the phrase
is an assumption&mdash;is a matter of time and place, a relative
matter altogether.&nbsp; There is a thing, and a generation finds
a name for it.&nbsp; The delicacy which prompts a later
generation to reject that name is by no means necessarily a
result of stricter habits, is far more often due to the flatness
which comes of untiring repetition and to the greater piquancy of
litotes.&nbsp; I am told that there are, or were, people in
America who reject the word &lsquo;leg&rsquo; as a gross word,
but they must have found a synonym.&nbsp; So there is not a word
in Congreve for which there is not some equivalent expression in
contemporary writing.&nbsp; He says this or that: your modern
writers say so-and-so.&nbsp; One man may even think the
monosyllables in better taste than the periphrases.&nbsp; Another
may sacrifice to his intolerance thereof such enjoyment as he was
capable of taking from the greatest triumphs of diction or
observation: he is free to choose.&nbsp; It may be granted that
to one unfamiliar with the English of two centuries since the
grossness of Congreve&rsquo;s language may seem <a
name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
viii</span>excessive&mdash;like splashes of colour occurring too
frequently in the arrangement of a wall.&nbsp; But that is merely
a result of novelty: given time and habit, a more artistic
perspective will be achieved.</p>
<p>The second question is more complex.&nbsp; Since Jeremy
Collier let off his <i>Short View of the Immorality and
Profaneness of the English Stage</i>, there has never lacked a
critic to chastise or to deplore&mdash;the more effective and
irritating course&mdash;not simply the coarseness but, the
immorality of our old comedies, their attitude towards and their
peculiar interests in life.&nbsp; Without affirming that we are
now come to the Golden Age of criticism, one may rejoice that
modern methods have taught quite humble critics to discriminate
between issues, and to deal with such a matter as this with some
mental detachment.&nbsp; The great primal fallacy comes from a
habit of expecting everything in everything.&nbsp; Just as in a
picture it is not enough for some people that it is well drawn
and well painted, but they demand an interesting story, a fine
sentiment, a great thought: so since our national glory is
understood to be the happy home, the happy home must be
triumphant everywhere, even in satiric comedy.&nbsp; The best
expression of this fallacy is in Thackeray.&nbsp; Concluding a
most eloquent, and a somewhat patronising examination of
Congreve, &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; he exclaims, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a
weary feast, that banquet of wit where no love is.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The answer is plain: comedy of manners is comedy of manners, and
satire is satire; introduce &lsquo;love&rsquo;&mdash;an appeal,
one supposes, to sympathy with strictly legitimate and common
affection and a glorification of the happy home&mdash;and the
rules of your art compel you to satirise affection and to make
the happy home ridiculous: a truly deplorable work, which the
incriminated dramatists were discreet enough for the most part to
avoid.&nbsp; The remark brings us to the first of the
half-truths, which cause the complexity of the subject.&nbsp; The
dramatists whose withers the well-intentioned and disastrous
Collier wrung seem to have thought their best answer <a
name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. ix</span>was to pose
as people with a mission&mdash;certainly Congreve so
posed&mdash;to reform the world with an exhibition of its
follies.&nbsp; An amusing answer, no doubt, of which the
absurdity is obvious!&nbsp; It does, however, contain a
half-truth.&nbsp; The idea of <i>The Way of the World&rsquo;s</i>
reforming adulterers&mdash;observe the quotation from Horace on
the title-page&mdash;is a little delicious; yet the exhibition in
a ludicrous light of the thing satirised is surely an end of
satiric comedy?&nbsp; The right of the matter is indicated in a
sentence which occurs in the dedication of <i>The
Double-Dealer</i> far more wisely than in Congreve&rsquo;s answer
to Collier: &lsquo;I should be very glad of an opportunity to
make my compliment to those ladies who are offended: but they can
no more expect it in a comedy, than to be tickled by a surgeon,
when he&rsquo;s letting &rsquo;em blood.&rsquo;&nbsp; Something
more than a half-truth is in Charles Lamb&rsquo;s theory, that
the old comedy &lsquo;has no reference whatever to the world that
is&rsquo;: that it is &lsquo;the Utopia of Gallantry&rsquo;
merely.&nbsp; Literally, historically, the theory is a
fantasy.&nbsp; What the Restoration dramatists did not borrow
from France was inspired directly by the court of Charles the
Second, and nobody conversant with the memoirs of that court can
have any difficulty in matching the fiction with reality.&nbsp; I
imagine that Congreve in part accepted a tradition of the stage,
but I am also perfectly well assured that he depicted what he
saw.&nbsp; How far the virtues we should associate with the
Charles the Second spirit may atone for its vices is a question
which would take us far into moral philosophy.&nbsp; It is enough
to remark that those vices are the exclusive possession of no
period: so long as society is constituted in anything like its
present order, there must be a section of it for which those
vices are the main interest in life.&nbsp; But Charles
Lamb&rsquo;s gay and engaging defiance of the kill-joys of his
day has this value: it is most certainly just to say that, in
appreciating satiric comedy, &lsquo;our coxcombical moral
sense&rsquo; must be &lsquo;for a little transitory ease
excluded.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. x</span>For one
may apprehend the whole truth to be somewhat thus.&nbsp; Satiric
comedy, or comedy of manners, is the art of making ludicrous in
dramatic form some phase of life.&nbsp; The writers of our old
comedy thought that certain vices&mdash;gambling, adultery, and
the like&mdash;formed a phase of life which for divers reasons,
essential and accidental, lent itself best to their
purpose.&nbsp; They may, or may not, have thought they were doing
society a service: their real justification is that, as artists,
they had to take for their art that material they could use
best.&nbsp; They used it according to their lights: Wycherley
with a coarse and heavy hand, so that it became nauseous;
Etherege with a light touch and a gay perception; Congreve with
an instinct of good-breeding, with a sure and extensive
observation, and with an incomparable style.&nbsp; But all were
justified in choosing for their material just what they
chose.&nbsp; They sinned artistically, now here, now there; but
to complain of this old comedy as a whole, that vice in it is
crammed too closely, is to forget that a play is a picture, not a
photograph, of life&mdash;is life arranged and coloured&mdash;and
that comedy of manners is composed of foibles or vices condensed
and relieved by one another.&nbsp; In so far as they overdid this
work, the comic writers were artistically at fault, and Jeremy
Collier was a good critic; but when he and his successors go
beyond the artistic objection, one takes leave to say, they
misapprehend the thing criticised.&nbsp; To complain that
&lsquo;love&rsquo; and common morality have no place in satiric
comedy is either to contemplate ridicule of them or to ask comedy
to be other than satiric.&nbsp; We know what happened when the
dramatists gave way: there followed, Hazlitt says, &lsquo;those
<i>do-me-good</i>, lack-a-daisical, whining, make-believe
comedies in the next age, which are enough to set one to sleep,
and where the author tries in vain to be merry and wise in the
same breath.&rsquo;&nbsp; These in place of &lsquo;the court, the
gala day of wit and pleasure, <a name="pagexi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xi</span>of gallantry, and Charles the
Second!&rsquo;&nbsp; And all because people would not keep their
functions distinct, and remember that as a comedy they were in a
court of art and not in a court of law!&nbsp; The old comedy is
dead, and its spirit gone from the stage: I have but endeavoured
to show that no harm need come to our phylacteries, if a flame
start from its ashes in the printed book.</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>William Congreve was born at Bardsey, near Leeds, and was
baptized on 10th February 1669 [1670].&nbsp; The Congreves were a
Staffordshire family, of an antiquity of four hundred years at
the date of the poet&rsquo;s birth.&nbsp; Richard, his
grandfather, was a redoubtable Cavalier, and William, his father,
an officer in the army.&nbsp; The latter was given a command at
Youghal, while his son was still an infant, and becoming shortly
afterwards agent to Lord Cork, removed to Lismore.&nbsp; So it
chanced that the poet had his schooling at Kilkenny (with Swift),
and proceeded to Trinity College, Dublin, in 1685, rejoining
Swift, and like his friend becoming a pupil of St. George Ashe,
the mathematician.&nbsp; In 1688 he left Dublin, remained with
his people in Staffordshire for some two years, entered himself
at the Temple, and came upon the town with <i>The Old
Bachelor</i> in January 1692.&nbsp; <i>The Double-Dealer</i> was
produced in November 1693.&nbsp; In 1694 a storm in the theatre
led to a secession of Betterton and other renowned players from
Drury Lane: with the result that a new playhouse was opened in
Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields, on 30th April 1695, with <i>Love for
Love</i>.&nbsp; In the same year Congreve was appointed
&lsquo;Commissioner for Licensing Hackney Coaches.&rsquo;&nbsp;
<i>The Mourning Bride</i> was produced in 1697, and was followed,
oddly enough, by the controversy, or rather &lsquo;row,&rsquo;
with Jeremy Collier.&nbsp; In March 1700 came <i>The Way of the
World</i>.&nbsp; The poet was made Commissioner <a
name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xii</span>of
Wine-Licences in 1705, and in 1714 with his Jamaica secretaryship
and his places in the Customs and the delightful
&lsquo;Pipe-Office,&rsquo; he had an income of twelve hundred
pounds a year.&nbsp; He died at his house in Surrey Street,
Strand, on 19th January 1728 [1729].</p>
<p>One or two comments on these dates are obvious.&nbsp; They
dissipate the Thackerayan fable that on the production of <i>The
Old Bachelor</i>, the fortunate young author received a shower of
sinecures, &lsquo;all for writing a comedy.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;And crazy Congreve scarce could spare<br />
A shilling to discharge a chair,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>writes Swift, and &lsquo;crazy&rsquo; indicates that Congreve
was gouty before he was rich.&nbsp; But then, the gout was a very
early factor in his life, and one may call the line an
exaggeration.&nbsp; Another couplet:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Thus Congreve spent in writing plays,<br />
And one poor office, half his days:&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>probably expresses the truth.&nbsp; With his plays and his
hackney coaches he doubtless got through his twenties and
thirties with no very hardly grinding poverty, and at forty or so
was comfortably secure.&nbsp; But another fact, which the dates
bring out very sharply, has a different interest.&nbsp; At an age
when Swift was beginning to try his powers, Congreve&rsquo;s work
was done.&nbsp; A few odes, a few letters he was still to write,
but no more comedies.&nbsp; Was it ill-health? or because the
town had all but damned his greatest play? or because he cared
more for life than for art?</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p>The question brings one to an attempted appreciation of the
man.&nbsp; Mr. Gosse, for whose <i>Life</i> I would express my
gratitude, confesses that &lsquo;it is not very easy to construct
a <a name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xiii</span>definite portrait of Congreve.&rsquo;&nbsp; But that
it baffled that very new journalist, Mrs. Manley, in his own day,
and Mr. Gosse, with his information, in ours, to give
&lsquo;salient points&rsquo; to Congreve&rsquo;s character,
proves in itself an essential characteristic, which need be
negatively stated only by choice.&nbsp; That no amusing
eccentricities are recorded, no ludicrous adventures, no
persistent quarrels, implies, taken with other facts we know,
that he was a well-bred man of the world, with the habit of
society: that in itself is a definite personal quality.&nbsp; One
supposes him an ease-loving man, not inclined to clown for the
amusement of his world.&nbsp; He was loved by his friends, being
tolerant, and understanding the art of social life.&nbsp; He was
successful, and must therefore have had enemies, but he was
careless to improve hostilities.&nbsp; For the temperament which
is so plain in the best of his writings must have been present in
his life&mdash;an unobtrusive, because a never directly implied,
superiority and an ironical humour.&nbsp; The picture of
swaggering snobbishness which Thackeray was inspired to make of
him is proved bad by all that we know.&nbsp; A swaggerer could
not have made a fast friend of Dryden&mdash;grown mellow, indeed,
but by no means beggared of his fire&mdash;on his first coming to
town, nor kept the intimacy of Swift, nor avoided the
fault-finding of Dennis.&nbsp; It is quite unnecessary to suppose
that Congreve&rsquo;s famous remark to Voltaire, that he wished
to be visited as a plain gentleman, was the remark (if it was
made) of a snob: it was clearly a legitimate deprecation, spoken
by a man who had written nothing notable for twenty-six years,
which Voltaire misunderstood in a moment of stupidity, or in one
of forgetfulness misrepresented.&nbsp; His superiority and his
irony came from a just sense of the perspective of things, and,
not preventing affection for his friends, left him indifferent to
his foes.&nbsp; Probably, also, a course of dissipation (at which
Swift hints) in his youth, acting on a temperament not
particularly ardent, had <a name="pagexiv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xiv</span>left him with such passions for war
and love as were well under control.&nbsp; The two women with
whom his name is connected were Mrs. Bracegirdle and the Duchess
of Marlborough; but nobody knew&mdash;though the latter&rsquo;s
mother hinted the worst&mdash;how far the intimacy went.&nbsp;
That is to say, no patent scandal was necessary to the connexion,
if in either case Congreve was a lover.&nbsp; And (once more)
Congreve was a gentleman.</p>
<p>But why did he become sterile at thirty?&nbsp; Where, if not
in dealing with motives and causes, may one be fancy-free?&nbsp;
Here there are many, of which the first to be given is mere
conjecture, but conjecture, I fancy, not inconsistent with such
facts as are known.&nbsp; When Congreve produced his first
comedy, he was but twenty-three, fresh from college and the
country, ignorant, as we are told, of the world.&nbsp; He
discovered very soon that he had an aptitude for social life,
that, no doubt, living humours and follies were as entertaining
as printed ones, that for a popular and witty man the world was
pleasant.&nbsp; But no man may be socially finished all at
once.&nbsp; In the course of the seven years between <i>The Old
Bachelor</i> and <i>The Way of the World</i>, Congreve must have
found his wit becoming readier, his tact surer, his appreciation
of natural comedy finer and (as personal keenness decreased) more
equable, his popularity greater, and&mdash;in fine&mdash;the
world more pleasant and the attractions of the study waning and
waning in comparison.&nbsp; He was a finished artist, he was
born, one might almost say, with a style; but his inclination was
to put his art into life rather than into print.&nbsp; Even in
our days (thank God for all His mercies!) everybody is not
writing a book.&nbsp; There are people whose talk has inimitable
touches, and whose lives are art, but who never sit down to a
quire of foolscap.&nbsp; I believe that Congreve naturally was
one of these, that his literary ambition was a result of
accidental necessity, and that had he lived as a boy in the
society he was of as a very young man&mdash;for all its literary
ornaments&mdash;we should have had <a name="pagexv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xv</span>of him only odes and songs.&nbsp; His
generation was idler and took itself less seriously than
ours.&nbsp; The primal curse was not imposed on everybody as a
duty.&nbsp; In seven years of growing appreciation Congreve came
to think the little graces and humours the better part.&nbsp;
That I believe to have been the first cause of his early
sterility; but others helped to determine the effect.&nbsp; A
certain indolence is of course implied in what has been
said.&nbsp; There was the gout, and there were his unfortunate
obesity and his failing sight.&nbsp; There was Henrietta, Duchess
of Marlborough, an absorbing dame.&nbsp; There were the success
of <i>Love for Love</i> and the failure of <i>The Way of the
World</i>.&nbsp; For all that may be said of the indifference of
the true artist to the verdict of the many-headed beast&mdash;and
Congreve&rsquo;s contempt was as fine as any&mdash;it is not
amusing when your play or your book falls flat, and Congreve must
have known that he might write another, and possibly a better,
<i>Way of the World</i>, but no more <i>Love for Loves</i>.&nbsp;
Not to anticipate a later division of the subject, it may be said
here that a man of thirty, of a fine intellect and a fine taste,
of a languid habit withal, and with an invalided constitution,
while he might repeat the triumphs of diction and intellect of
<i>The Way of the World</i>, was most unlikely to return to the
broader humours and the more popular gaiety of the other
play.&nbsp; Congreve, like Rochester before him, despised the
judgment of the town in these matters, but by the town he would
have to be judged.</p>
<p>He was a witty, handsome man of the world, of imperturbable
temper and infinite tact, who could make and keep the friendship
of very various men, and be intimate with a woman without
quarrelling with her lovers.&nbsp; He had a taste for pictures
and a love for music.&nbsp; He must have hated violence and
uproar, and liked the finer shades of life.&nbsp; He wore the
mode of his day, and was free from the superficial protests of
the narrow-minded.&nbsp; Possibly not a very &lsquo;definite
portrait,&rsquo; possibly a very <a name="pagexvi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xvi</span>negative characterisation.&nbsp;
Possibly, also, a tolerably sure foundation for a structure of
sympathetic imagination.</p>
<h3>IV.</h3>
<p>Passing from necessarily vague and not obviously pertinent
remarks to criticism, which may fairly be less diffident, we
leave Congreve&rsquo;s life and come to his work, to his
&lsquo;tawdry playhouse taper,&rsquo; as Thackeray called
it.&nbsp; It is only after the man has appeared that we recognise
that he came at the hour; but the nature of the hour is in this
case not difficult to be discerned.&nbsp; The habit of playgoing
was well-established; the turmoil of the Revolution was over; De
Jure was at a comfortable distance, and De Facto&rsquo;s wife was
a patroness of the arts.&nbsp; But playgoers had but to be shown
something better than that they had, to discover that the
convention of the Restoration needed new blood.&nbsp; A
justification of its choice of material has been attempted: there
is no inconsistency in affirming that the tendency to use it with
a mere monotony of ribaldry was emphatic.&nbsp; Of this tendency
the most notable and useful illustration is Wycherley, because in
point of wit and dramatic skill he dwarfed his colleagues.&nbsp;
As Mr. Swinburne has said, the art of Congreve is different in
kind, not merely in degree, from the cruder and more boisterous
product of the &lsquo;brawny&rsquo; dramatist.&nbsp; Happily,
however, for his success, the difference was not instantly
clear.&nbsp; His first play links him with Wycherley, not with
that rare and faint embryo of the later Congreve, George
Etherege.&nbsp; &lsquo;You was always a gentleman, Mr.
George,&rsquo; as the valet says in <i>Beau Austin</i>.&nbsp;
Happily for his popularity Congreve first followed the more
popular man.&nbsp; It is not, indeed, until he wrote his last
play that he was a whole Etherege idealised, albeit a greater
than Etherege in the meantime.&nbsp; The peculiar effect which
Etherege achieved in <i>Sir Fopling Flutter</i>&mdash;at whom and
with whom you laugh at <a name="pagexvii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xvii</span>once&mdash;was not sublimated (the
fineness left, the faintness become firmness) until Congreve
created Witwoud, the inimitable, in <i>The Way of the
World</i>.</p>
<p>At the very first Congreve had good fortune in his
players.&nbsp; It was a brave time for them.&nbsp; True, their
salaries were not wonderfully large.&nbsp; Colley Cibber
complains of the days before the revolt in 1694: &lsquo;at what
unequal salaries the hired actors were held by the absolute
authority of their frugal masters, the patentees.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But the example was not faded of those gay days when they were
the pets of the most artistic court that England has known: when
great ladies carried Kynaston in his woman&rsquo;s dress to Hyde
Park after the play, and the King was the most persistent and the
most interested playgoer in his realm.&nbsp; They were not thus
petted for irrelevant reasons&mdash;for their respectability,
their piety, or their domestic virtues; and their recognition as
artists by an artistic society did not spoil their art.&nbsp;
When Congreve started on his course of play-writing, Queen Mary
kept up, in a measure, the amiable custom of her uncle.&nbsp; He
was very fortunate in his casts.&nbsp; There was Betterton, first
of all, the versatile, the restrained, and, witness everybody,
the incomparable.&nbsp; There was Underhill, &lsquo;a correct and
natural comedian&rsquo;&mdash;one must quote Cibber pretty often
in this connexion&mdash;not well suited, one must suppose, to
play Setter to Betterton&rsquo;s Heartwell in <i>The Old
Bachelor</i>, but by reason of his admirable assumption of
stupidity to make an excellent Sir Sampson in <i>Love for
Love</i>.&nbsp; There were Powel, Williams, Verbruggen, Bowen,
and Dogget (Fondlewife in the first play: afterwards Ben Legend,
a part which made his fame and turned his head)&mdash;all notable
comedians.&nbsp; Kynaston, graceful in old age as he had been
beautiful in youth, was not in <i>The Old Bachelor</i>, but
created Lord Touchwood in <i>The Double-Dealer</i>.&nbsp;
Mountfort had been murdered by my Lord Mohun, and Leigh had
followed him to the grave, but their names lived in their <a
name="pagexviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xviii</span>wives.&nbsp; Mrs. Mountfort &lsquo;was mistress of
more variety of humour than I ever knew in any one woman actress
. . . nothing, though ever so barren, if within the bounds of
nature, could be flat in her hands.&rsquo;&nbsp; Indeed
&lsquo;she was so fond of humour, in what low part soever to be
found, that she would make no scruple of defacing her fair form
to come heartily into it&rsquo;&mdash;assuredly a rare
actress!&nbsp; About Mrs. Leigh Cibber is less enthusiastic, but
grants her &lsquo;a good deal of humour&rsquo;: her old women
were famous.&nbsp; Mrs. Barry was a stately, dignified actress,
best, no doubt, in tragedy.&nbsp; Lastly, there was Mrs.
Bracegirdle, the innocent <i>publica cura</i>, whom authors
courted through their plays, and who had all the men in the house
for longing lovers.&nbsp; Who shall say how far &lsquo;her youth
and lively aspect&rsquo; influenced the criticisms that have come
down to us?&nbsp; She played Millamant to Congreve&rsquo;s
satisfaction.</p>
<h3>V.</h3>
<p>It is not difficult to understand how it was that Dryden
thought <i>The Old Bachelor</i> the best first play he had seen,
and the town applauded to the echo.&nbsp; But it is a little hard
to understand why later critics, with the three other comedies
before them, have not more expressly marked the difference
between the first and those.&nbsp; There is no new tune in <i>The
Old Bachelor</i>: it is an old tune more finely played, and for
that very reason it met with immediate acceptance.&nbsp; It is
not likely that Dryden&mdash;a great poet and a great and
generous critic, it may be, but an old man&mdash;would have
bestowed such unhesitating approval on a play which ignored the
conventions in which he had lived.&nbsp; As it was, he saw those
conventions reverently followed, yet served by a master
wit.&nbsp; The fact that Congreve allowed Dryden and others to
&lsquo;polish&rsquo; his play, by giving it an air of the stage
and the town which it lacked, need not of course spoil it for
us.&nbsp; The stamp of Congreve is clearly marked on <a
name="pagexix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xix</span>the
dialogue, though not on every page.&nbsp; You may see its
essentials in two passages taken absolutely at random.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Come, come,&rsquo; says Bellmour in the very first scene,
&lsquo;leave business to idlers and wisdom to fools; they have
need of &rsquo;em: wit be my faculty and pleasure my occupation,
and let Father Time shake his glass.&rsquo;&nbsp; Or Fondlewife
soliloquises: &lsquo;Tell me, Isaac, why art thee jealous?&nbsp;
Why art thee distrustful of the wife of thy bosom?&nbsp; Because
she is young and vigorous, and I am old and impotent.&nbsp; Then
why didst thee marry, Isaac?&nbsp; Because she was beautiful and
tempting, and because I was obstinate and doating. . .
.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the one passage is the gay and skilfully light
paradox, in the other the clean, rhythmical, and balanced, yet
dramatic and appropriate English that are elements of
Congreve&rsquo;s style.&nbsp; It is in the conventions of its
characterisation that <i>The Old Bachelor</i> belongs, not to
true Congrevean comedy but, to that of the models from which he
was to break away.&nbsp; The characterisation of <i>The Way of
the World</i> is light and true, that of <i>The Old Bachelor</i>
is heavy and yet vague.&nbsp; Vainlove indeed, the &lsquo;mumper
in love,&rsquo; who &lsquo;lies canting at the gate,&rsquo; is
individual and Congrevean.&nbsp; But Heartwell, the blustering
fool, Bellmour, the impersonal rake, Wittol and Bluffe, the
farcical sticks, Fondlewife, the immemorial city husband, and the
troop of undistinguished women&mdash;what can be said of them but
that they are glaring stage properties, speaking better English
than the comic stage had before attracted?&nbsp; Germs, possibly,
of better things to come, that is all, so far as characterisation
goes.&nbsp; The Fondlewife episode, in particular, which
doubtless was mightily popular&mdash;what is there more in it
than the mutton fisted wit and brutality of Wyeherley, with some
of Congreve&rsquo;s English?&nbsp; Such scenes as these, it may
be hazarded, so contemptible in the light of Congreve&rsquo;s
better work, are ineffective now because they fall between two
stools: between the comedy (or tragedy) of a crude physical fact,
naked and <a name="pagexx"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xx</span>impossible, as in Rochester, and the comedy (or tragedy)
of delicately-phrased intrigue.&nbsp; The latter was yet to come
when this play was produced, and meantime such episodes went very
well, and their popularity is intelligible.&nbsp; For the rest
<i>The Old Bachelor</i>, though to us in these days its plot
appear a somewhat uninspiring piece of fairyland, was a good
acting play, fitted with great skill to its actual players.&nbsp;
The part of Fondlewife, created by Dogget, was on a revival
played (to his own immense satisfaction) by Colley Cibber.&nbsp;
In Araminta Mrs. Bracegirdle began (in a faint outline as it
were) the series of lively, sympathetic, intelligent heroines
which Congreve wrote for her.&nbsp; Lord Falkland&rsquo;s
Prologue is as funny as it is indecently suggestive, which is
saying a great deal.&nbsp; The one actually spoken gave an
opportunity of the merriest archness to Mrs. Bracegirdle, and was
calculated to put the audience in the best of good humours.</p>
<p>The faults of <i>The Double-Dealer</i> are obvious on a first
reading, and were very justly condemned on a first acting.&nbsp;
The intrigue is wearisome: its involutions are ineffectively
puzzling.&nbsp; Maskwell&rsquo;s villainy and Mellefont&rsquo;s
folly are both unconvincing.&nbsp; The tragedy of Lady Touchwood,
less tragic than that of Lady Wishfort in <i>The Way of the
World</i>, is more obviously than that out of the picture.&nbsp;
The play is, in fact, not pure comedy of manners: it is that
<i>plus</i> tragedy, an element less offensive than the
sentimentality which spoils <i>The School for Scandal</i>, but
yet a notable fault.&nbsp; For while you can resolve the tragedy
of Lady Wishfort into wicked and very grim comedy, you can do
nothing with the tragedy of Lady Touchwood but try to ignore
it.&nbsp; In his epistle dedicatory to Charles Montague, Congreve
admits that his play has faults, but does not take in hand those
adduced above, with the exception of the objections to Maskwell
and Mellefont.&nbsp; &lsquo;They have mistaken cunning in one
character for folly in another&rsquo;: an ineffectual answer,
because the extremity <a name="pagexxi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxi</span>of cunning is equally destructive of
dramatic balance.&nbsp; He defends his use of soliloquy very
warmly: of which it may be said that, so long as his
rule&mdash;that no character may overhear the
soliloquiser&mdash;is observed, it is a tolerable convention, but
a confession of weakness in construction.&nbsp; He declares he
&lsquo;would rather disoblige all the critics in the world than
one of the fair sex,&rsquo; and, having made his bow, he turns
upon the ladies and rends them.&nbsp; An author campaigning
against his critics is always a pleasant spectacle, but
Congreve&rsquo;s defence of <i>The Double-Dealer</i> is rather
amusing than convincing.</p>
<p>It needed no defence; for with all its faults, such as they
are, upon it, there are in it scenes and characters which only
Congreve could have made.&nbsp; Brisk is a worthy forerunner of
Witwoud, Sir Paul Plyant a delicious old credulous fool; while
the tyrannical and vain Lady Plyant is so drawn that you almost
love her.&nbsp; But the triumph is Lady Froth, &lsquo;a great
coquet, pretender to poetry, wit, and learning,&rsquo; and one
would almost as lief have seen Mrs. Mountfort in the part as the
Bracegirdle&rsquo;s Millamant.&nbsp; Her serious folly and
foolish wisdom, her poem and malice and compliments and babbling
vivacity&mdash;set off, it is fair to remember, by a pretty
face&mdash;are atonement for a dozen Maskwells.&nbsp; She is a
female Witwoud, her author&rsquo;s first success in a sort of
character he draws to perfection.&nbsp; The scene between
Mellefont and Lady Plyant, where she insists on believing that
the gallant, under cover of a marriage with her stepdaughter,
purposes to lead her astray, and where she goes through a
delightful farce of answering her scruples before the bewildered
man&mdash;the scene that for some far-fetched reason led
Macaulay&rsquo;s mind to the incest in the <i>Oedipus
Rex</i>&mdash;is perhaps the best comedy of situation in the
piece.&nbsp; But the scene of defamation between the Froths and
Brisk is notable as (with the Cabal idea in <i>The Way of the
World</i>) the inspiration of the Scandal Scenes in <a
name="pagexxii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxii</span>Sheridan&rsquo;s play.&nbsp; When we remember that
less than two years were gone since the production of <i>The Old
Bachelor</i>, the improvement in Congreve is remarkable.&nbsp;
Almost his only concession to the groundlings is the star-gazing
episode of Lady Froth and Brisk: a mistake, because it spoils her
inconsequent folly, but a small matter.&nbsp; In his second play
Congreve was himself, the wittiest and most polished writer of
comedy in English.&nbsp; In the face of this fact &lsquo;the
public&rsquo; conducted itself characteristically: it more or
less damned <i>The Double-Dealer</i> until the queen approved,
when it applauded lustily.&nbsp; That occasion gave Colley Cibber
his first chance as Kynaston&rsquo;s substitute in Lord
Touchwood.&nbsp; When one remembers Dryden&rsquo;s long,
struggling, cudgelling and cudgelled life, it is impossible to
read without emotion his tribute to a very young and successful
author in the verses prefixed to this play:</p>
<blockquote><p>Firm Doric pillars found your solid base:<br />
The fair Corinthian crowns the higher space;<br />
Thus all below is strength, and all above is grace.<br />
. . . . .<br />
We cannot envy you, because we love.<br />
. . . . .<br />
Time, place, and action may with pains be wrought,<br />
But Genius must be born, and never can be taught.<br />
This is your portion, this your native store;<br />
Heav&rsquo;n, that but once was prodigal before.<br />
To Shakespeare gave as much; she could not give him more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tribute is indubitably sincere; in point of
Congreve&rsquo;s wit and diction it is as indubitably true.</p>
<p><i>Love for Love</i> was the most popular of Congreve&rsquo;s
comedies: it held the stage so long that Hazlitt could say,
&lsquo;it still acts and is still acted well.&rsquo;&nbsp; Being
wise after the event, one may give some obvious reasons.&nbsp; It
is more human than any other of his plays, and at the same time
more farcical.&nbsp; By &lsquo;more human&rsquo; it is not meant
that the characters are truer to life than those in <a
name="pagexxiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxiii</span><i>The
Way of the World</i>, but that they are truer to average life,
and therefore more easily recognisable by the average
spectator.&nbsp; Tattle, for instance, is so gross a fool, that
any fool in the pit could see his folly; Witwoud might deceive
all but the elect.&nbsp; No familiarity&mdash;direct or
indirect&mdash;with a particular mode of life and speech is
necessary to the appreciation of <i>Love for Love</i>.&nbsp; Sir
Sampson Legend is your unmistakable heavy father, cross-grained
and bullying.&nbsp; Valentine is no ironical, fine gentleman like
Mirabell, but a young rake from Cambridge, all debts and high
spirits.&nbsp; Scandal is a plain railer at things, especially
women; Ben Legend a sea-dog who cannot speak without a nautical
metaphor; Jeremy an idealised comic servant; and Foresight
grotesque farce.&nbsp; Angelica is a shrewd but hearty
&lsquo;English girl,&rsquo; and Miss Prue a veritable country
Miss; while Mrs. Frail and Mrs. Foresight are broadly skittish
matrons.&nbsp; There is nothing in the play to strain the
attention or to puzzle the intellect, and it is full of laughter:
no wonder it was a success.&nbsp; It is, intellectually, on an
altogether different plane from <i>The Way of the World</i>, on a
slightly lower one than <i>The Double-Dealer</i>.&nbsp; But in
its own way it is irresistibly funny, and by reason of its
diction it is never for a moment other than distinguished.</p>
<p>I imagine the bodkin scene will always take the palm in it for
mere mirth.&nbsp; Delightful sisters!</p>
<blockquote><p>I suppose you would not go alone to the
World&rsquo;s End?</p>
<p>The World&rsquo;s End!&nbsp; What, do you mean to banter
me?</p>
<p>Poor innocent!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s a
place called the World&rsquo;s End?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll swear you can keep your countenance purely;
you&rsquo;d make an admirable player. . . .&nbsp; But look you
here, now&mdash;where did you lose this gold bodkin?&mdash;Oh,
sister, sister!</p>
<p>My bodkin?</p>
<p>Nay, &rsquo;tis yours; look at it.</p>
<p>Well, if you go to that, where did you find this bodkin?&nbsp;
Oh, sister, sister!&mdash;sister every way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="pagexxiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxiv</span>Broad, popular comedy, it is admirable; but it is not
especially Congrevean.&nbsp; Tattle&rsquo;s love-lesson to Miss
Prue and his boasting of his duchesses are in the same broad
vein.&nbsp; Valentine&rsquo;s mad scene is more remarkable, in
that Congreve gives rein to his fancy, and that his diction is at
its very best.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hark&rsquo;ee, I have a secret to
tell you.&nbsp; Endymion and the Moon shall meet us upon Mount
Latmos, and will be married in the dead of night.&nbsp; But say
not a word.&nbsp; Hymen shall put his torch into a dark lanthorn,
that it may be secret, and Juno shall give her peacock
poppy-water, that he may fold his ogling tail, and Argus&rsquo;s
hundred eyes be shut, ha?&nbsp; Nobody shall know, but
Jeremy.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>TATTLE.&nbsp; Do you know me, Valentine?</p>
<p>VALENTINE.&nbsp; You?&nbsp; Who are you?&nbsp; No, I hope
not.</p>
<p>TATTLE.&nbsp; I am Jack Tattle, your friend.</p>
<p>VALENTINE.&nbsp; My friend, what to do?&nbsp; I am no married
man, and thou canst not lie with my wife.&nbsp; I am very poor,
and thou canst not borrow money of me.&nbsp; Then, what
employment have I for a friend?</p>
<p>ANGELICA.&nbsp; Do you know me, Valentine?</p>
<p>VALENTINE.&nbsp; Oh, very well.</p>
<p>ANGELICA.&nbsp; Who am I?</p>
<p>VALENTINE.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a woman, one to whom Heaven gave
beauty when it grafted roses on a briar.&nbsp; You are the
reflection of Heaven in a pond, and he that leaps at you is
sunk.&nbsp; You are all white, a sheet of lovely, spotless paper,
when you first are born; but you are to be scrawled and blotted
by every goose&rsquo;s quill.&nbsp; I know you; for I loved a
woman, and loved her so long, that I found out a strange thing: I
found out what a woman was good for.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine Betterton, the greatest actor of his time, delivering
that last speech, with its incomparable rhythm!&nbsp; I like to
think that he gave the spectators an idea that Valentine&rsquo;s
self-sacrifice for Angelica was nothing but a bold device, a
calculated effect; otherwise the sacrifice is an excrescence in
this comedy, which, popular and broad though it be, is cynical in
Congreve&rsquo;s manner throughout.&nbsp; One is consoled,
however, by the pleasant <a name="pagexxv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxv</span>fate of the ingenious Mr. Tattle and
the intriguing Mrs. Frail, who are left tied for life against
their will.&nbsp; The trick, by the way, of a tricked marriage is
constant in Congreve, and reveals his poverty of
construction.&nbsp; He can devise you comic situations
unflaggingly, but when he approaches the end of a play his
<i>deus ex machin&acirc;</i> is invariably this flattest and most
battered old deity in fairyland.</p>
<p>The dedication to Lord Dorset contains nothing of interest
beyond the confession that the play is too long, and the
information that part of it was omitted in the playing.&nbsp; A
line in the prologue, &lsquo;We grieve One falling Adam and one
tempted Eve,&rsquo; is explained by Colley Cibber to refer to
Mrs. Mountford, who, having cast her lot with Betterton and
migrated to Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields, threw up her part on a
question of cash, and to Williams, an actor who &lsquo;loved his
bottle better than his business,&rsquo; who deserted at the same
time.&nbsp; It serves to show the interest the town took in the
players, that the fact was referred to on the stage.&nbsp; The
lady&rsquo;s part was taken by Mrs. Ayliff; Mrs. Leigh played the
nurse&mdash;a very poor part after Lady Plyant; Dogget&rsquo;s
success as Ben Legend has been noted.&nbsp; Mrs.
Bracegirdle&rsquo;s Angelica was doubtless ravishing: a
&lsquo;virtuous young woman,&rsquo; as our ancestors phrased it,
but quite relieved from insipidity.</p>
<p>It would need a greater presumption than the writer is gifted
withal to add his contribution to the praises critics have
lavished on <i>The Way of the World</i>.&nbsp; It is better to
quote Mr. Swinburne.&nbsp; &lsquo;In 1700 Congreve replied to
Collier with the crowning work of his genius&mdash;the unequalled
and unapproached masterpiece of English comedy.&nbsp; The one
play in our language which may fairly claim a place beside, or
but just beneath, the mightiest work of Moli&egrave;re, is <i>The
Way of the World</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; But he continues: &lsquo;On
the stage, which had recently acclaimed with uncritical applause
the author&rsquo;s more questionable appearance <a
name="pagexxvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxvi</span>in the
field of tragedy,&rsquo;&mdash;<i>The Mourning
Bride</i>,&mdash;&lsquo;this final and flawless evidence of his
incomparable powers met with a rejection then and ever since
inexplicable on any ground of conjecture.&rsquo;&nbsp; There the
critics are not unanimous.&nbsp; Mr. Gosse, for instance, has his
explanation: that the spectators must have fidgeted, and wished
&lsquo;that the actors and actresses would be doing
something.&rsquo;&nbsp; Very like, indeed: the spectators, then
as now, would no doubt have preferred &lsquo;knock-about
farce.&rsquo;&nbsp; But, I venture to think, the explanation is
not complete.&nbsp; The construction of the play is weak,
certainly, but the actors and actresses do a great deal after
all.&nbsp; For that matter, audiences will stand scenes of still
wit&mdash;but they like to comprehend it; and the characters in
<i>The Way of the World</i>, or most of them, represent a society
whose attitude and speech are entirely ironical and paradoxical,
a society of necessity but a small fraction of any
community.&nbsp; Some sort of study or some special experience is
necessary to the enjoyment of such a set.&nbsp; It is not the
case of a few witticisms and paradoxes firing off at intervals,
like crackers, from the mouths of one or two actors with whom the
audience is taught to laugh as a matter of course: the vein is
unbroken.&nbsp; Now, literalness and common sense are the
qualities of the average uninstructed spectator, and <i>The Way
of the World</i> was high over the heads of its audience.</p>
<p>To come to details.&nbsp; The tragedy of Lady Wishfort has
often been remarked&mdash;the veritable tragedy of a lovesick old
woman.&nbsp; All the grotesque touches, her credulity, her
vanity, her admirable dialect (&lsquo;as I&rsquo;m a
person!&rsquo;), but serve to make the tragedy the more
pitiable.&nbsp; Either, therefore, our appreciation of satiric
comedy is defective, or Congreve made a mistake.&nbsp; To regard
this poor old soul as mere comedy is to attain to an almost
satanic height of contempt: the comedy is more than grim, it is
savagely cruel.&nbsp; To be pitiless, on the other hand, is a
satirist&rsquo;s virtue.&nbsp; On the whole, we may reasonably <a
name="pagexxvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxvii</span>say
that the tragedy is not too keen in itself, but that it is too
obviously indicated.&nbsp; Witwoud is surely a great
character?&nbsp; The stage is alive with mirth when he is on
it.&nbsp; His entrance in the very first part of the play is
delightful.&nbsp; &lsquo;Afford me your compassion, my dears;
pity me, Fainall; Mirabell, pity me. . . . Fainall, how does your
lady?&nbsp; Gad, I say anything in the world to get this fellow
out of my head.&nbsp; I beg pardon that I should ask a man of
pleasure, and the town, a question at once so foreign and
domestic.&nbsp; But I talk like an old maid at a marriage, I
don&rsquo;t know what I say.&rsquo;&nbsp; But one might quote for
ever.&nbsp; Witwoud, almost as much as Millamant herself, is an
eternal type.&nbsp; His little exclamations, his assurance of
sympathy, his terror of the commonplace&mdash;surely one knows
them well?&nbsp; His tolerance of any impertinence, lest he
should be thought to have misunderstood a jest, is a great
distinction.&nbsp; But Congreve&rsquo;s gibe in the dedication at
the critics, who failed &lsquo;to distinguish betwixt the
character of a Witwoud and a Truewit,&rsquo; is hardly fair: as
Dryden said of Etherege&rsquo;s Sir Fopling, he is &lsquo;a fool
so nicely writ, The ladies might mistake him for a
wit.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, Millamant is the ultimate expression of
those who, having all the material goods which nature and
civilisation can give, live on paradoxes and artifices.&nbsp; Her
insolence is the inoffensive insolence only possible to the
well-bred.&nbsp; &lsquo;O ay, letters,&mdash;I had
letters,&mdash;I am persecuted with letters,&mdash;I hate
letters,&mdash;nobody knows how to write letters; and yet one has
&rsquo;em, one does not know why,&mdash;they serve one to pin up
one&rsquo;s hair.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Beauty the lover&rsquo;s
gift!&mdash;Lord, what is a lover, that it can give?&nbsp; Why
one makes lovers as fast as one pleases, and they live as long as
one pleases, and they die as soon as one pleases; and then if one
pleases one makes more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In parts of its characterisation <i>The Way of the World</i>
is extremely bold in observation, extremely careless of literary
<a name="pagexxviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxviii</span>types and traditions.&nbsp; Mrs. Fainall, a woman
who is the friend, and assists in the intrigues, of a man who has
ceased to be her lover, is most unconventionally human.&nbsp; Of
all the inimitable scenes, that in which Millamant and Mirabell
make their conditions of marriage is perhaps the most
unquestionable triumph.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let us never visit together,
nor go to a play together, but let us be very strange and
well-bred&rsquo;&mdash;there is its keynote.&nbsp; The dialogue
is as sure and perfect in diction, in balance of phrases, and in
musical effectiveness as can be conceived, and for all its care
is absolutely free in its gaiety.&nbsp; It is the ultimate
expression of the joys of the artificial.&nbsp; As for the
prologue, it is an invitation to the dullards to damn the play,
and is anything but serenely confident.&nbsp; The dedication, to
&lsquo;Ralph, Earl of Mountague,&rsquo; has an interesting fact:
it tells us that the comedy was written immediately after staying
with him, &lsquo;in your retirement last summer from the
town,&rsquo; and pays a tribute to the influence of the society
the dramatist met there.&nbsp; &lsquo;Vous y voyez
partout,&rsquo; said Voltaire of Congreve, &lsquo;le langage des
honn&ecirc;tes gens avec des actions de fripon; ce qui prouve
qu&rsquo;il connaissait bien son monde, et qu&rsquo;il vivait
dans ce qu&rsquo;on appelle la bonne compagnie.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The want of dramatic skill which has been alleged against
Congreve is simply a question of construction&mdash;of the
construction of his plays as a whole.&nbsp; His plots hang fire,
are difficult to follow, and are not worth remembering.&nbsp; But
many things besides go to the making of good plays, and few
playwrights have had all the theatrical virtues.&nbsp; Do we not
pardon a lack of incident in a novel of character?&nbsp; In this
connexion it is worth while to contrast Congreve with Sheridan,
who in the matter of construction was a far abler
craftsman.&nbsp; But is there not in the elder poet enough to
turn the scale, even the theatrical scale, ten times over?&nbsp;
Compare the petty indignation, with which the dramatist of <i>The
School for Scandal</i> deals with <a name="pagexxix"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxix</span>his scandalmongers, and the amused
indifference of Congreve towards the cabalists in <i>The Way of
the World</i>.&nbsp; Or take any hero of Congreve&rsquo;s and
contrast him with that glorification of vulgar lavishness and
canting generosity, that very barmaid&rsquo;s hero, Charles
Surface.&nbsp; It is all very well to say that Joseph is the real
hero; but Sheridan made it natural for the stupid sentimentality
of later days to make him the villain, and Congreve would have
made it impossible.&nbsp; Of wit (of course) there is more in a
scene of Congreve than in a play of Sheridan.&nbsp; Moreover,
faulty in construction as his main plots are, in detail his
construction is often admirable: as in play of character upon
character, in countless opportunities for delightful archness and
cruelty in the women, for the display of every comic emotion in
the men.&nbsp; He lived in the playhouse, and his characters,
true to life though they be, have about them as it were an ideal
essence of the boards.&nbsp; With Hazlitt, &lsquo;I would rather
have seen Mrs. Abington&rsquo;s Millamant than any Rosalind that
ever appeared on the stage.&rsquo;&nbsp; A lover and a constant
frequenter of the theatre&mdash;albeit the plays he sees bore him
to death&mdash;cannot, in reading Congreve, choose but see the
glances and hear the intonations of imaginary players.</p>
<h3>VI.</h3>
<p>Congreve&rsquo;s choice of material has been defended at an
early stage of these remarks.&nbsp; There is the further and more
interesting question of his point of view, his attitude towards
it.&nbsp; Mr. Henley speaks of his &lsquo;deliberate and
unmitigable baseness of morality.&rsquo;&nbsp; Differing with
deference, I think it may be shown that his attitude is a pose
merely, and an artistic and quite innocent pose.&nbsp; It is the
amusing pose of the boyish cynic turned into an artistic
convention.&nbsp; The lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;He alone won&rsquo;t betray in whom none
will confide,<br />
And the nymph may be chaste that has never been tried:&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="pagexxx"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxx</span>which
conclude the characteristic song in the third act of <i>Love for
Love</i>, are typical of his attitude.&nbsp; Does anybody suppose
that an intelligent man of the world meant that sentiment in all
seriousness?</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Nothing&rsquo;s new besides our faces,<br
/>
Every woman is the same&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>those lines (in his first play), which seemed so shocking to
Thackeray, what more do they express than the green cynicism of
youth?&nbsp; When Mr. Leslie Stephen speaks of his &lsquo;gush of
cynical sentiment,&rsquo; he speaks unsympathetically, but the
phrase, to be an enemy&rsquo;s, is just.&nbsp; It is cynical
sentiment, and the hostility comes from taking it
seriously.&nbsp; I think it the most artistic attitude for a
writer of gay, satiric comedies, and that its very excess should
prevent its being taken for more than a convention.&nbsp; We are
not called upon to see satiric comedies all day long, and the
question, everlastingly asked by implication of every work of
art&mdash;&lsquo;Would you like to live with it?&rsquo;&mdash;is
here, as in most other cases, irrelevant.&nbsp; One is reminded
that there is more in life than intrigues and cynical comments on
them.&nbsp; And one is inclined to put the questions in answer:
&lsquo;Does a man who really feels the sorrowful things of life,
its futile endeavours and piteous separations, find relief in
seeing his emotions mimicked on the stage in a
&lsquo;wholesome&rsquo; play of sentiment with a happy
ending?&nbsp; Is he not rather comforted by the distractions of
cheerful frivolity, of conventional denial of his
pains?&rsquo;&nbsp; The demand is as inartistic and irrelevant as
the criticism which suggested it, but it returns a sufficient
reply.&nbsp; It does not touch the &lsquo;catharsis&rsquo; of
tragedy, which is another matter.&nbsp; For the rest,
Congreve&rsquo;s attitude, cynicism apart, is an attitude of
irony and superiority over common emotions, the attitude,
artificial and inoffensive, of the society he depicts in his
greatest play.&nbsp; He enjoys the humours of his puppets, he <a
name="pagexxxi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxxi</span>is never
angry with them.&nbsp; It is the attitude of an artist in
expounding human nature, of an expert in observation of life: an
attitude attainable but by very few, and disliked as a rule by
the rest, who want to clap or to hiss&mdash;who can laugh but who
cannot smile.</p>
<h3>VII.</h3>
<p>When Congreve left the stage, said Dennis the critic,
&lsquo;comedy left it with him.&rsquo;&nbsp; Vanburgh and
Farquhar were left to expound comedy of manners, the one with a
vigorous gusto, the other with a romantic gaiety.&nbsp; The
peculiar perfume of <i>The Way of the World</i> was given to
neither, yet they wrote comedy of manners.&nbsp; But if Congreve
left colleagues, he left no sons, and most certainly, one may
say, that when those colleagues died, English comedy took to her
bed.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Comic Muse, long sick, is now
a-dying,&rsquo; wrote Garrick in his prologue to <i>She Stoops to
Conquer</i>, and she had not to apologise, like Charles the
Second, for the unconscionable time she was about it.&nbsp; It is
a little crude to attribute her demise to Jeremy Collier and his
<i>Short View</i>&mdash;a block painted to look like a
thunderbolt.&nbsp; It is not a matter of decency, of alteration
or improvement in manners.&nbsp; A comedy might be wholly
Congrevean without a coarse word from beginning to end.&nbsp; It
is a matter of the exclusion (not the stultification), the
suspension of moral prepossessions, the absence of sympathetic
sentimentalism, the habit of shirking nothing and smiling at all
things.&nbsp; These qualities are not characteristic of the
average Englishman.&nbsp; Now, satiric comedy did not in its
initiation depend upon the average Englishman.&nbsp; It took its
cue from the court of Charles the Second, who&mdash;with a dash
of thoroughly English humour&mdash;was more than half-French in
temperament, and attracted to himself all that was artistically
frivolous in his kingdom.&nbsp; Questions of decency and
morality&mdash;<a name="pagexxxii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxii</span>which after all are not perpetually
amusing&mdash;apart, the social spirit typified in this
exceptional king is one of sceptical humour and ironical smiles:
it takes common emotions for granted&mdash;is bored by them, in
fact&mdash;and is a foe to sentimentality and gush and virtuously
happy endings.&nbsp; It was the spirit of Charles the Second that
inspired English comedy, and inspired it most thoroughly in
Congreve but a few years after Charles&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; Under
changed conditions, one is apt to underestimate the influence of
the Court upon the Town two hundred years ago.&nbsp; Well, the
Georges became our defenders of the faith, and they hated
&lsquo;boets and bainters.&rsquo;&nbsp; English comedy was thrown
back upon the patronage and the inspiration of average England,
and up to the time of writing has shown few signs of
recovery.&nbsp; Of course, the decay was gradual: you may see it
at a most interesting stage in <i>The School for Scandal</i>, a
comedy of manners with a strong dash of common
sentimentality.&nbsp; It would be just possible, one conceives,
to play <i>The School for Scandal</i> as Charles Lamb says he saw
it played, with Joseph for a hero, as a comedy of manners: you
can just imagine Sir Peter as a sort of Sir Paul Plyant, and as
not played to raise a lump in your throat.&nbsp; But Sheridan
made it a difficult task.&nbsp; Perhaps you may see the evil
influence at its worst in the so-called comedies which were our
glory twenty-five years ago: in such a play as <i>Caste</i>, an
even river of sloppy sentiment, where the acme of chivalrous
delicacy is to refrain from lighting a cigarette in a
woman&rsquo;s presence, where the triumph of humour is for a
guardsman to take a kettle off the fire, and where the character
of Eccles shows what excellent comedy the author might (alas!)
have written.</p>
<p>One is fain to ask if the spirit of Congrevean comedy will
ever come back to our stage.&nbsp; An echo of it has been heard
in dialogue once or twice in the last few years: not a trace has
<a name="pagexxxiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxiii</span>been seen in action.&nbsp; And yet we permit our
dramatists a pretty wide range of subjects.&nbsp; We allow the
subjects: it is the Congrevean attitude towards them which we
should condemn.&nbsp; But the stage would be all the merrier if
we could only understand that that attitude is harmless; that to
see the humorous aspect of a thing is not to ignore the pathetic
or the sociological; and that we should return all the heartier
to our serious and sentimental considerations of the problems of
life for allowing them to be laughed at for an evening at a
comedy.&nbsp; Meantime we can read the book.</p>

<h2>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE CHARLES, LORD CLIFFORD OF
LANESBOROUGH, <span class="GutSmall">ETC.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;It is with a great
deal of pleasure that I lay hold on this first occasion which the
accidents of my life have given me of writing to your lordship:
for since at the same time I write to all the world, it will be a
means of publishing (what I would have everybody know) the
respect and duty which I owe and pay to you.&nbsp; I have so much
inclination to be yours that I need no other engagement.&nbsp;
But the particular ties by which I am bound to your lordship and
family have put it out of my power to make you any compliment,
since all offers of myself will amount to no more than an honest
acknowledgment, and only shew a willingness in me to be
grateful.</p>
<p>I am very near wishing that it were not so much my interest to
be your lordship&rsquo;s servant, that it might be more my merit;
not that I would avoid being obliged to you, but I would have my
own choice to run me into the debt: that I might have it to
boast, I had distinguished a man to whom I would be glad to be
obliged, even without the hopes of having it in my power ever to
make him a return.</p>
<p>It is impossible for me to come near your lordship in any kind
and not to receive some favour; and while in appearance I am only
making an acknowledgment (with the usual underhand dealing of the
world) I am at the same time insinuating my own interest.&nbsp; I
cannot give your lordship your due, without tacking a bill of my
own privileges.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true, if a man never committed a
folly, he would never stand in need of a protection.&nbsp; But
then power would have nothing to do, and good nature no occasion
to show itself; and where those qualities are, &rsquo;tis pity
they should want objects to shine upon.&nbsp; I must confess this
is no reason why a man should do an idle thing, nor indeed any
good excuse for it when done; yet it reconciles the uses of such
authority and goodness to the necessities of our follies, and is
a sort of poetical logic, which at this time I would make use of,
to argue your lordship into a protection of this play.&nbsp; It
is the first offence I have committed in this kind, or indeed, in
any kind of poetry, though not the first made public, and
therefore I hope will the more easily be pardoned.&nbsp; But had
it been acted, when it was first written, more might have been
said in its behalf: ignorance of the town and stage would then
have been excuses in a young writer, which now almost four
years&rsquo; experience will scarce allow of.&nbsp; Yet I must
declare myself sensible of the good nature of the town, in
receiving this play so kindly, with all its faults, which I must
own were, for the most part, very industriously covered by the
care of the players; for I think scarce a character but received
all the advantage it would admit of from the justness of the
action.</p>
<p>As for the critics, my lord, I have nothing to say to, or
against, any of them of any kind: from those who make just
exceptions, to those who find fault in the wrong place.&nbsp; I
will only make this general answer in behalf of my play (an
answer which Epictetus advises every man to make for himself to
his censurers), viz.: &lsquo;That if they who find some faults in
it, were as intimate with it as I am, they would find a great
many more.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is a confession, which I needed not
to have made; but however, I can draw this use from it to my own
advantage: that I think there are no faults in it but what I do
know; which, as I take it, is the first step to an amendment.</p>
<p>Thus I may live in hopes (sometime or other) of making the
town amends; but you, my lord, I never can, though I am ever your
lordship&rsquo;s most obedient and most humble servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">WILL. CONGREVE.</p>
<h2>TO MR. CONGREVE.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">When</span> virtue in
pursuit of fame appears,<br />
And forward shoots the growth beyond the years.<br />
We timely court the rising hero&rsquo;s cause,<br />
And on his side the poet wisely draws,<br />
Bespeaking him hereafter by applause.<br />
The days will come, when we shall all receive<br />
Returning interest from what now we give,<br />
Instructed and supported by that praise<br />
And reputation which we strive to raise.<br />
Nature so coy, so hardly to be wooed,<br />
Flies, like a mistress, but to be pursued.<br />
O Congreve! boldly follow on the chase:<br />
She looks behind and wants thy strong embrace:<br />
She yields, she yields, surrenders all her charms,<br />
Do you but force her gently to your arms:<br />
Such nerves, such graces, in your lines appear,<br />
As you were made to be her ravisher.<br />
Dryden has long extended his command,<br />
By right divine, quite through the muses&rsquo; land,<br />
Absolute lord; and holding now from none,<br />
But great Apollo, his undoubted crown.<br />
That empire settled, and grown old in power<br />
Can wish for nothing but a successor:<br />
Not to enlarge his limits, but maintain<br />
Those provinces, which he alone could gain.<br />
His eldest Wycherly, in wise retreat,<br />
Thought it not worth his quiet to be great.<br />
Loose, wand&rsquo;ring Etherege, in wild pleasures tost,<br />
And foreign int&rsquo;rests, to his hopes long lost:<br />
Poor Lee and Otway dead!&nbsp; Congreve appears,<br />
The darling, and last comfort of his years.<br />
May&rsquo;st thou live long in thy great master&rsquo;s
smiles,<br />
And growing under him, adorn these isles.<br />
But when&mdash;when part of him (be that but late)<br />
His body yielding must submit to fate,<br />
Leaving his deathless works and thee behind<br />
(The natural successor of his mind),<br />
Then may&rsquo;st thou finish what he has begun:<br />
Heir to his merit, be in fame his son.<br />
What thou hast done, shews all is in thy pow&rsquo;r,<br />
And to write better, only must write more.<br />
&rsquo;Tis something to be willing to commend;<br />
But my best praise is, that I am your friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">THO. SOUTHERNE.</p>
<h2>TO MR. CONGREVE.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> danger&rsquo;s
great in these censorious days,<br />
When critics are so rife to venture praise:<br />
When the infectious and ill-natured brood<br />
Behold, and damn the work, because &rsquo;tis good,<br />
And with a proud, ungenerous spirit, try<br />
To pass an ostracism on poetry.<br />
But you, my friend, your worth does safely bear<br />
Above their spleen; you have no cause for fear;<br />
Like a well-mettled hawk, you took your flight<br />
Quite out of reach, and almost out of sight.<br />
As the strong sun, in a fair summer&rsquo;s day,<br />
You rise, and drive the mists and clouds away,<br />
The owls and bats, and all the birds of prey.<br />
Each line of yours, like polished steel&rsquo;s so hard,<br />
In beauty safe, it wants no other guard.<br />
Nature herself&rsquo;s beholden to your dress,<br />
Which though still like, much fairer you express.<br />
Some vainly striving honour to obtain,<br />
Leave to their heirs the traffic of their brain:<br />
Like China under ground, the ripening ware,<br />
In a long time, perhaps grows worth our care.<br />
But you now reap the fame, so well you&rsquo;ve sown;<br />
The planter tastes his fruit to ripeness grown.<br />
As a fair orange-tree at once is seen<br />
Big with what&rsquo;s ripe, yet springing still with green,<br />
So at one time, my worthy friend appears,<br />
With all the sap of youth, and weight of years.<br />
Accept my pious love, as forward zeal,<br />
Which though it ruins me I can&rsquo;t conceal:<br />
Exposed to censure for my weak applause,<br />
I&rsquo;m pleased to suffer in so just a cause;<br />
And though my offering may unworthy prove,<br />
Take, as a friend, the wishes of my love.</p>

<h2>TO MR. CONGREVE, ON HIS PLAY CALLED<br />
THE OLD BACHELOR.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Wit</span>, like true gold,
refined from all allay,<br />
Immortal is, and never can decay:<br />
&rsquo;Tis in all times and languages the same,<br />
Nor can an ill translation quench the flame:<br />
For, though the form and fashion don&rsquo;t remain,<br />
The intrinsic value still it will retain.<br />
Then let each studied scene be writ with art,<br />
And judgment sweat to form the laboured part.<br />
Each character be just, and nature seem:<br />
Without th&rsquo; ingredient, wit, &rsquo;tis all but phlegm:<br
/>
For that&rsquo;s the soul, which all the mass must move,<br />
And wake our passions into grief or love.<br />
But you, too bounteous, sow your wit so thick,<br />
We are surprised, and know not where to pick;<br />
And while with clapping we are just to you,<br />
Ourselves we injure, and lose something new.<br />
What mayn&rsquo;t we then, great youth, of thee presage,<br />
Whose art and wit so much transcend thy age?<br />
How wilt thou shine at thy meridian height,<br />
Who, at thy rising, giv&rsquo;st so vast a light?<br />
When Dryden dying shall the world deceive,<br />
Whom we immortal, as his works, believe,<br />
Thou shalt succeed, the glory of the stage,<br />
Adorn and entertain the coming age.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">BEVIL. HIGGONS.</p>
<h2>PROLOGUE INTENDED FOR THE OLD BACHELOR.<br />
Written by the <span class="smcap">Lord Falkland</span>.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Most</span> authors on the
stage at first appear<br />
Like widows&rsquo; bridegrooms, full of doubt and fear:<br />
They judge, from the experience of the dame,<br />
How hard a task it is to quench her flame;<br />
And who falls short of furnishing a course<br />
Up to his brawny predecessor&rsquo;s force,<br />
With utmost rage from her embraces thrown,<br />
Remains convicted as an empty drone.<br />
Thus often, to his shame, a pert beginner<br />
Proves in the end a miserable sinner.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As for our youngster, I am apt to doubt him,<br />
With all the vigour of his youth about him;<br />
But he, more sanguine, trusts in one and twenty,<br />
And impudently hopes he shall content you:<br />
For though his bachelor be worn and cold,<br />
He thinks the young may club to help the old,<br />
And what alone can be achieved by neither,<br />
Is often brought about by both together.<br />
The briskest of you all have felt alarms,<br />
Finding the fair one prostitute her charms<br />
With broken sighs, in her old fumbler&rsquo;s arms:<br />
But for our spark, he swears he&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er be
jealous<br />
Of any rivals, but young lusty fellows.<br />
Faith, let him try his chance, and if the slave,<br />
After his bragging, prove a washy knave,<br />
May he be banished to some lonely den<br />
And never more have leave to dip his pen.<br />
But if he be the champion he pretends,<br />
Both sexes sure will join to be his friends,<br />
For all agree, where all can have their ends.<br />
And you must own him for a man of might,<br />
If he holds out to please you the third night.</p>
<h2>PROLOGUE.<br />
Spoken by <span class="smcap">Mrs. Bracegirdle</span>.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">How</span> this vile world
is changed!&nbsp; In former days<br />
Prologues were serious speeches before plays,<br />
Grave, solemn things, as graces are to feasts,<br />
Where poets begged a blessing from their guests.<br />
But now no more like suppliants we come;<br />
A play makes war, and prologue is the drum.<br />
Armed with keen satire and with pointed wit,<br />
We threaten you who do for judges sit,<br />
To save our plays, or else we&rsquo;ll damn your pit.<br />
But for your comfort, it falls out to-day,<br />
We&rsquo;ve a young author and his first-born play;<br />
So, standing only on his good behaviour,<br />
He&rsquo;s very civil, and entreats your favour.<br />
Not but the man has malice, would he show it,<br />
But on my conscience he&rsquo;s a bashful poet;<br />
You think that strange&mdash;no matter, he&rsquo;ll outgrow
it.<br />
Well, I&rsquo;m his advocate: by me he prays you<br />
(I don&rsquo;t know whether I shall speak to please you),<br />
He prays&mdash;O bless me! what shall I do now?<br />
Hang me if I know what he prays, or how!<br />
And &rsquo;twas the prettiest prologue as he wrote it!<br />
Well, the deuce take me, if I han&rsquo;t forgot it.<br />
O Lord, for heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s sake excuse the play,<br />
Because, you know, if it be damned to-day,<br />
I shall be hanged for wanting what to say.<br />
For my sake then&mdash;but I&rsquo;m in such confusion,<br />
I cannot stay to hear your resolution.</p>

<h3>SCENE I.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">SCENE: <i>The Street</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Bellmour</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Vainlove</span>
<i>meeting</i>.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Vainlove, and abroad so early!&nbsp; Good-morrow;
I thought a contemplative lover could no more have parted with
his bed in a morning than he could have slept in&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Bellmour, good-morrow.&nbsp; Why, truth on&rsquo;t
is, these early sallies are not usual to me; but business, as you
see, sir&mdash;[<i>Showing Letters</i>.]&nbsp; And business must
be followed, or be lost.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Business!&nbsp; And so must time, my friend, be
close pursued, or lost.&nbsp; Business is the rub of life,
perverts our aim, casts off the bias, and leaves us wide and
short of the intended mark.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Pleasure, I guess you mean.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Ay; what else has meaning?</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Oh, the wise will tell you&mdash;</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; More than they believe&mdash;or understand.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; How, how, Ned!&nbsp; A wise man say more than he
understands?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Ay, ay!&nbsp; Wisdom&rsquo;s nothing but a
pretending to know and believe more than we really do.&nbsp; You
read of but one wise man, and all that he knew was, that he knew
nothing.&nbsp; Come, come, leave business to idlers and wisdom to
fools; they have need of &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Wit be my faculty, and
pleasure my occupation; and let Father Time shake his
glass.&nbsp; Let low and earthly souls grovel till they have
worked themselves six foot deep into a grave.&nbsp; Business is
not my element&mdash;I roll in a higher orb, and dwell&mdash;</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; In castles i&rsquo; th&rsquo; air of thy own
building.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s thy element, Ned.&nbsp; Well, as
high a flier as you are, I have a lure may make you stoop.&nbsp;
[<i>Flings a Letter</i>.]</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; I, marry, sir, I have a hawk&rsquo;s eye at a
woman&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s more elegancy in the
false spelling of this superscription [<i>takes up the
Letter</i>] than in all Cicero.&nbsp; Let me see.&mdash;How
now!&mdash;Dear <i>perfidious Vainlove</i>.&nbsp;
[<i>Reads</i>.]</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Hold, hold, &rsquo;slife, that&rsquo;s the
wrong.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Nay, let&rsquo;s see the
name&mdash;Sylvia!&mdash;how canst thou be ungrateful to that
creature?&nbsp; She&rsquo;s extremely pretty, and loves thee
entirely&mdash;I have heard her breathe such raptures about
thee&mdash;</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Ay, or anybody that she&rsquo;s about&mdash;</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; No, faith, Frank, you wrong her; she has been just
to you.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s pleasant, by my troth, from thee, who
hast had her.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Never&mdash;her affections.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true,
by heaven: she owned it to my face; and, blushing like the virgin
morn when it disclosed the cheat which that trusty bawd of
nature, night, had hid, confessed her soul was true to you;
though I by treachery had stolen the bliss.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; So was true as turtle&mdash;in
imagination&mdash;Ned, ha?&nbsp; Preach this doctrine to
husbands, and the married women will adore thee.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Why, faith, I think it will do well enough, if the
husband be out of the way, for the wife to show her fondness and
impatience of his absence by choosing a lover as like him as she
can; and what is unlike, she may help out with her own fancy.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; But is it not an abuse to the lover to be made a
blind of?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; As you say, the abuse is to the lover, not the
husband.&nbsp; For &rsquo;tis an argument of her great zeal
towards him, that she will enjoy him in effigy.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; It must be a very superstitious country where such
zeal passes for true devotion.&nbsp; I doubt it will be damned by
all our Protestant husbands for flat idolatry.&nbsp; But, if you
can make Alderman Fondlewife of your persuasion, this letter will
be needless.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; What!&nbsp; The old banker with the handsome
wife?</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Ay.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Let me see&mdash;<i>L&aelig;titia</i>!&nbsp; Oh,
&rsquo;tis a delicious morsel.&nbsp; Dear Frank, thou art the
truest friend in the world.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Ay, am I not?&nbsp; To be continually starting of
hares for you to course.&nbsp; We were certainly cut out for one
another; for my temper quits an amour just where thine takes it
up.&nbsp; But read that; it is an appointment for me, this
evening&mdash;when Fondlewife will be gone out of town, to meet
the master of a ship, about the return of a venture which
he&rsquo;s in danger of losing.&nbsp; Read, read.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; [<i>reads</i>.]&nbsp; Hum, Hum&mdash;Out of town
this evening, and talks of sending for Mr. Spintext to keep me
company; but I&rsquo;ll take care he shall not be at home.&nbsp;
Good!&nbsp; Spintext!&nbsp; Oh, the fanatic one-eyed parson!</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Ay.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; [<i>reads</i>.]&nbsp; Hum, Hum&mdash;That your
conversation will be much more agreeable, if you can counterfeit
his habit to blind the servants.&nbsp; Very good!&nbsp; Then I
must be disguised?&mdash;With all my heart!&mdash;It adds a gusto
to an amour; gives it the greater resemblance of theft; and,
among us lewd mortals, the deeper the sin the sweeter.&nbsp;
Frank, I&rsquo;m amazed at thy good nature&mdash;</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Faith, I hate love when &rsquo;tis forced upon a
man, as I do wine.&nbsp; And this business is none of my seeking;
I only happened to be, once or twice, where L&aelig;titia was the
handsomest woman in company; so, consequently, applied myself to
her&mdash;and it seems she has taken me at my word.&nbsp; Had you
been there, or anybody, &rsquo;t had been the same.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; I wish I may succeed as the same.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Never doubt it; for if the spirit of cuckoldom be
once raised up in a woman, the devil can&rsquo;t lay it, until
she has done&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Prithee, what sort of fellow is Fondlewife?</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; A kind of mongrel zealot, sometimes very precise
and peevish.&nbsp; But I have seen him pleasant enough in his
way; much addicted to jealousy, but more to fondness; so that as
he is often jealous without a cause, he&rsquo;s as often
satisfied without reason.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; A very even temper, and fit for my purpose.&nbsp;
I must get your man Setter to provide my disguise.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Ay; you may take him for good and all, if you
will, for you have made him fit for nobody else.&nbsp;
Well&mdash;</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re going to visit in return of
Sylvia&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp; Poor rogue!&nbsp; Any hour of the
day or night will serve her.&nbsp; But do you know nothing of a
new rival there?</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Yes; Heartwell&mdash;that surly, old, pretended
woman-hater&mdash;thinks her virtuous; that&rsquo;s one reason
why I fail her.&nbsp; I would have her fret herself out of
conceit with me, that she may entertain some thoughts of
him.&nbsp; I know he visits her every day.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Yet rails on still, and thinks his love unknown to
us.&nbsp; A little time will swell him so, he must be forced to
give it birth; and the discovery must needs be very pleasant from
himself, to see what pains he will take, and how he will strain
to be delivered of a secret, when he has miscarried of it
already.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Well, good-morrow.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s dine
together; I&rsquo;ll meet at the old place.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; With all my heart.&nbsp; It lies convenient for us
to pay our afternoon services to our mistresses.&nbsp; I find I
am damnably in love, I&rsquo;m so uneasy for not having seen
Belinda yesterday.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; But I saw my Araminta, yet am as impatient.</p>
<h3>SCENE II.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Bellmour</span>
<i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Why, what a cormorant in love am I!&nbsp; Who, not
contented with the slavery of honourable love in one place, and
the pleasure of enjoying some half a score mistresses of my own
acquiring, must yet take Vainlove&rsquo;s business upon my hands,
because it lay too heavy upon his; so am not only forced to lie
with other men&rsquo;s wives for &rsquo;em, but must also
undertake the harder task of obliging their mistresses.&nbsp; I
must take up, or I shall never hold out.&nbsp; Flesh and blood
cannot bear it always.</p>
<h3>SCENE III.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">[<i>To him</i>] <span
class="smcap">Sharper</span>.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry to see this, Ned.&nbsp; Once a
man comes to his soliloquies, I give him for gone.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Sharper, I&rsquo;m glad to see thee.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; What! is Belinda cruel, that you are so
thoughtful?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; No, faith, not for that.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s a
business of consequence fallen out to-day that requires some
consideration.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Prithee, what mighty business of consequence
canst thou have?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Why, you must know, &rsquo;tis a piece of work
toward the finishing of an alderman.&nbsp; It seems I must put
the last hand to it, and dub him cuckold, that he may be of equal
dignity with the rest of his brethren: so I must beg
Belinda&rsquo;s pardon.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Faith, e&rsquo;en give her over for good and all;
you can have no hopes of getting her for a mistress; and she is
too proud, too inconstant, too affected and too witty, and too
handsome for a wife.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; But she can&rsquo;t have too much money.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s twelve thousand pound, Tom.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true
she is excessively foppish and affected; but in my conscience I
believe the baggage loves me: for she never speaks well of me
herself, nor suffers anybody else to rail at me.&nbsp; Then, as I
told you, there&rsquo;s twelve thousand pound.&nbsp; Hum!&nbsp;
Why, faith, upon second thoughts, she does not appear to be so
very affected neither.&mdash;Give her her due, I think the
woman&rsquo;s a woman, and that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; As such,
I&rsquo;m sure I shall like her; for the devil take me if I
don&rsquo;t love all the sex.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; And here comes one who swears as heartily he
hates all the sex.</p>
<h3>SCENE IV.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">[<i>To them</i>] <span
class="smcap">Heartwell</span>.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Who?&nbsp; Heartwell?&nbsp; Ay, but he knows
better things.&nbsp; How now, George, where hast thou been
snarling odious truths, and entertaining company, like a
physician, with discourse of their diseases and
infirmities?&nbsp; What fine lady hast thou been putting out of
conceit with herself, and persuading that the face she had been
making all the morning was none of her own?&nbsp; For I know thou
art as unmannerly and as unwelcome to a woman as a looking-glass
after the smallpox.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; I confess I have not been sneering fulsome lies
and nauseous flattery; fawning upon a little tawdry whore, that
will fawn upon me again, and entertain any puppy that comes, like
a tumbler, with the same tricks over and over.&nbsp; For such, I
guess, may have been your late employment.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Would thou hadst come a little sooner.&nbsp;
Vainlove would have wrought thy conversion, and been a champion
for the cause.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; What! has he been here?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s one of
love&rsquo;s April fools; is always upon some errand that&rsquo;s
to no purpose; ever embarking in adventures, yet never comes to
harbour.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s because he always sets out in foul
weather, loves to buffet with the winds, meet the tide, and sail
in the teeth of opposition.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; What!&nbsp; Has he not dropt anchor at
Araminta?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Truth on&rsquo;t is she fits his temper best, is a
kind of floating island; sometimes seems in reach, then vanishes
and keeps him busied in the search.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; She had need have a good share of sense to manage
so capricious a lover.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Faith I don&rsquo;t know, he&rsquo;s of a temper
the most easy to himself in the world; he takes as much always of
an amour as he cares for, and quits it when it grows stale or
unpleasant.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; An argument of very little passion, very good
understanding, and very ill nature.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; And proves that Vainlove plays the fool with
discretion.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; You, Bellmour, are bound in gratitude to stickle
for him; you with pleasure reap that fruit, which he takes pains
to sow: he does the drudgery in the mine, and you stamp your
image on the gold.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s of another opinion, and says I do the
drudgery in the mine.&nbsp; Well, we have each our share of
sport, and each that which he likes best; &rsquo;tis his
diversion to set, &rsquo;tis mine to cover the partridge.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; And it should be mine to let &rsquo;em go
again.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Not till you had mouthed a little, George.&nbsp;
I think that&rsquo;s all thou art fit for now.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Good Mr. Young-Fellow, you&rsquo;re mistaken; as
able as yourself, and as nimble, too, though I mayn&rsquo;t have
so much mercury in my limbs; &rsquo;tis true, indeed, I
don&rsquo;t force appetite, but wait the natural call of my lust,
and think it time enough to be lewd after I have had the
temptation.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Time enough, ay, too soon, I should rather have
expected, from a person of your gravity.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Yet it is oftentimes too late with some of you
young, termagant, flashy sinners&mdash;you have all the guilt of
the intention, and none of the pleasure of the
practice&mdash;&rsquo;tis true you are so eager in pursuit of the
temptation, that you save the devil the trouble of leading you
into it.&nbsp; Nor is it out of discretion that you don&rsquo;t
swallow that very hook yourselves have baited, but you are cloyed
with the preparative, and what you mean for a whet, turns the
edge of your puny stomachs.&nbsp; Your love is like your courage,
which you show for the first year or two upon all occasions; till
in a little time, being disabled or disarmed, you abate of your
vigour; and that daring blade which was so often drawn, is bound
to the peace for ever after.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Thou art an old fornicator of a singular good
principle indeed, and art for encouraging youth, that they may be
as wicked as thou art at thy years.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; I am for having everybody be what they pretend to
be: a whoremaster be a whoremaster, and not like Vainlove, kiss a
lap-dog with passion, when it would disgust him from the
lady&rsquo;s own lips.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; That only happens sometimes, where the dog has the
sweeter breath, for the more cleanly conveyance.&nbsp; But,
George, you must not quarrel with little gallantries of this
nature: women are often won by &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Who would refuse
to kiss a lap-dog, if it were preliminary to the lips of his
lady?</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Or omit playing with her fan, and cooling her if
she were hot, when it might entitle him to the office of warming
her when she should be cold?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; What is it to read a play in a rainy day?&nbsp;
Though you should be now and then interrupted in a witty scene,
and she perhaps preserve her laughter, till the jest were over;
even that may be borne with, considering the reward in
prospect.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; I confess you that are women&rsquo;s asses bear
greater burdens: are forced to undergo dressing, dancing,
singing, sighing, whining, rhyming, flattering, lying, grinning,
cringing, and the drudgery of loving to boot.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; O brute, the drudgery of loving!</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Ay!&nbsp; Why, to come to love through all these
incumbrances is like coming to an estate overcharged with debts,
which, by the time you have paid, yields no further profit than
what the bare tillage and manuring of the land will produce at
the expense of your own sweat.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Prithee, how dost thou love?</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; He!&nbsp; He hates the sex.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; So I hate physic too&mdash;yet I may love to take
it for my health.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Well come off, George, if at any time you should
be taken straying.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; He has need of such an excuse, considering the
present state of his body.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; How d&rsquo;ye mean?</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Why, if whoring be purging, as you call it, then,
I may say, marriage is entering into a course of physic.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; How, George!&nbsp; Does the wind blow there?</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; It will as soon blow north and by
south&mdash;marry, quotha!&nbsp; I hope in heaven I have a
greater portion of grace, and I think I have baited too many of
those traps to be caught in one myself.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Who the devil would have thee? unless &rsquo;twere
an oysterwoman to propagate young fry for Billingsgate&mdash;thy
talent will never recommend thee to anything of better
quality.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; My talent is chiefly that of speaking truth,
which I don&rsquo;t expect should ever recommend me to people of
quality.&nbsp; I thank heaven I have very honestly purchased the
hatred of all the great families in town.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; And you in return of spleen hate them.&nbsp; But
could you hope to be received into the alliance of a noble
family&mdash;</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; No; I hope I shall never merit that affliction,
to be punished with a wife of birth, be a stag of the first head
and bear my horns aloft, like one of the supporters of my
wife&rsquo;s coat.&nbsp; S&rsquo;death I would not be a Cuckold
to e&rsquo;er an illustrious whore in England.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; What, not to make your family, man and provide for
your children?</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; For her children, you mean.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Ay, there you&rsquo;ve nicked it.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s the devil upon devil.&nbsp; Oh, the pride and joy
of heart &rsquo;twould be to me to have my son and heir resemble
such a duke; to have a fleering coxcomb scoff and cry, &lsquo;Mr.
your son&rsquo;s mighty like his Grace, has just his smile and
air of&rsquo;s face.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then replies another,
&lsquo;Methinks he has more of the Marquess of such a place about
his nose and eyes, though he has my Lord
what-d&rsquo;ye-call&rsquo;s mouth to a tittle.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then
I, to put it off as unconcerned, come chuck the infant under the
chin, force a smile, and cry, &lsquo;Ay, the boy takes after his
mother&rsquo;s relations,&rsquo; when the devil and she knows
&rsquo;tis a little compound of the whole body of nobility.</p>
<p>BELL+SHARP.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Well, but, George, I have one question to ask
you&mdash;</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Pshaw, I have prattled away my time.&nbsp; I hope
you are in no haste for an answer, for I shan&rsquo;t stay
now.&nbsp; [<i>Looking on his watch</i>.]</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Nay, prithee, George&mdash;</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; No; besides my business, I see a fool coming this
way.&nbsp; Adieu.</p>
<h3>SCENE V.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Sharper</span>,
<span class="smcap">Bellmour</span>.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; What does he mean?&nbsp; Oh, &rsquo;tis Sir Joseph
Wittoll with his friend; but I see he has turned the corner and
goes another way.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; What in the name of wonder is it?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Why, a fool.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a tawdry outside.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; And a very beggarly lining&mdash;yet he may be
worth your acquaintance; a little of thy chymistry, Tom, may
extract gold from that dirt.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Say you so?&nbsp; &rsquo;Faith I am as poor as a
chymist, and would be as industrious.&nbsp; But what was he that
followed him?&nbsp; Is not he a dragon that watches those golden
pippins?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Hang him, no, he a dragon!&nbsp; If he be,
&rsquo;tis a very peaceful one.&nbsp; I can ensure his anger
dormant; or should he seem to rouse, &rsquo;tis but well lashing
him, and he will sleep like a top.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Ay, is he of that kidney?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Yet is adored by that bigot, Sir Joseph Wittoll,
as the image of valour.&nbsp; He calls him his back, and indeed
they are never asunder&mdash;yet, last night, I know not by what
mischance, the knight was alone, and had fallen into the hands of
some night-walkers, who, I suppose, would have pillaged
him.&nbsp; But I chanced to come by and rescued him, though I
believe he was heartily frightened; for as soon as ever he was
loose, he ran away without staying to see who had helped him.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Is that bully of his in the army?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; No; but is a pretender, and wears the habit of a
soldier, which nowadays as often cloaks cowardice, as a black
gown does atheism.&nbsp; You must know he has been
abroad&mdash;went purely to run away from a campaign; enriched
himself with the plunder of a few oaths, and here vents them
against the general, who, slighting men of merit, and preferring
only those of interest, has made him quit the service.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Wherein no doubt he magnifies his own
performance.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Speaks miracles, is the drum to his own
praise&mdash;the only implement of a soldier he resembles, like
that, being full of blustering noise and emptiness&mdash;</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; And like that, of no use but to be beaten.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Right; but then the comparison breaks, for he will
take a drubbing with as little noise as a pulpit cushion.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; His name, and I have done?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Why, that, to pass it current too, he has gilded
with a title: he is called Capt. Bluffe.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll endeavour his
acquaintance&mdash;you steer another course, are bound&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">For love&rsquo;s island: I, for the golden
coast.<br />
May each succeed in what he wishes most.</p>

Wittoll</span>, <span class="smcap">Sharper</span>
<i>following</i>.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Sure that&rsquo;s he, and alone.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Um&mdash;Ay, this, this is the very damned
place; the inhuman cannibals, the bloody-minded villains, would
have butchered me last night.&nbsp; No doubt they would have
flayed me alive, have sold my skin, and devoured, etc.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; How&rsquo;s this!</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; An it hadn&rsquo;t been for a civil gentleman as
came by and frighted &rsquo;em away&mdash;but, agad, I durst not
stay to give him thanks.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; This must be Bellmour he means.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; I
have a thought&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Zooks, would the captain would come; the very
remembrance makes me quake; agad, I shall never be reconciled to
this place heartily.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis but trying, and being where I am at
worst, now luck!&mdash;cursed fortune! this must be the place,
this damned unlucky place&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Agad, and so &rsquo;tis.&nbsp; Why, here has
been more mischief done, I perceive.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; No, &rsquo;tis gone, &rsquo;tis lost&mdash;ten
thousand devils on that chance which drew me hither; ay, here,
just here, this spot to me is hell; nothing to be found, but the
despair of what I&rsquo;ve lost.&nbsp; [<i>Looking about as in
search</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Poor gentleman!&nbsp; By the Lord Harry
I&rsquo;ll stay no longer, for I have found too&mdash;</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Ha! who&rsquo;s that has found?&nbsp; What have
you found?&nbsp; Restore it quickly, or by&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Not I, sir, not I; as I&rsquo;ve a soul to be
saved, I have found nothing but what has been to my loss, as I
may say, and as you were saying, sir.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Oh, your servant, sir; you are safe, then, it
seems.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis an ill wind that blows nobody good.&nbsp;
Well, you may rejoice over my ill fortune, since it paid the
price of your ransom.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; I rejoice! agad, not I, sir: I&rsquo;m very
sorry for your loss, with all my heart, blood and guts, sir; and
if you did but know me, you&rsquo;d ne&rsquo;er say I were so
ill-natured.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Know you!&nbsp; Why, can you be so ungrateful to
forget me?</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; O Lord, forget him!&nbsp; No, no, sir, I
don&rsquo;t forget you&mdash;because I never saw your face
before, agad.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; How!&nbsp; [<i>Angrily</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Stay, stay, sir, let me
recollect&mdash;he&rsquo;s a damned angry fellow&mdash;I believe
I had better remember him, until I can get out of his sight; but
out of sight out of mind, agad.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Methought the service I did you last night, sir,
in preserving you from those ruffians, might have taken better
root in your shallow memory.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Gads-daggers-belts-blades and scabbards, this is
the very gentleman!&nbsp; How shall I make him a return suitable
to the greatness of his merit?&nbsp; I had a pretty thing to that
purpose, if he ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t frighted it out of my
memory.&nbsp; Hem! hem! sir, I most submissively implore your
pardon for my transgression of ingratitude and omission; having
my entire dependence, sir, upon the superfluity of your goodness,
which, like an inundation, will, I hope, totally immerge the
recollection of my error, and leave me floating, in your sight,
upon the full-blown bladders of repentance&mdash;by the help of
which, I shall once more hope to swim into your favour.&nbsp;
[<i>Bows</i>.]</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; So-h, oh, sir, I am easily pacified, the
acknowledgment of a gentleman&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Acknowledgment!&nbsp; Sir, I am all over
acknowledgment, and will not stick to show it in the greatest
extremity by night or by day, in sickness or in health, winter or
summer; all seasons and occasions shall testify the reality and
gratitude of your superabundant humble servant, Sir Joseph
Wittoll, knight.&nbsp; Hem! hem!</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Sir Joseph Wittoll?</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; The same, sir, of Wittoll Hall in
<i>Comitatu</i> Bucks.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Is it possible!&nbsp; Then I am happy to have
obliged the mirror of knighthood and pink of courtesie in the
age.&nbsp; Let me embrace you.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; O Lord, sir!</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; My loss I esteem as a trifle repaid with
interest, since it has purchased me the friendship and
acquaintance of the person in the world whose character I
admire.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; You are only pleased to say so, sir.&nbsp; But,
pray, if I may be so bold, what is that loss you mention?</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Oh, term it no longer so, sir.&nbsp; In the
scuffle last night I only dropt a bill of a hundred pound, which,
I confess, I came half despairing to recover; but, thanks to my
better fortune&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; You have found it, sir, then, it seems; I
profess I&rsquo;m heartily glad&mdash;</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Sir, your humble servant.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
question but you are, that you have so cheap an opportunity of
expressing your gratitude and generosity, since the paying so
trivial a sum will wholly acquit you and doubly engage me.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; What a dickens does he mean by a trivial
sum?&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; But ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you found
it, sir!</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; No otherwise, I vow to Gad, but in my hopes in
you, sir.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Humh.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s sufficient.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twere
injustice to doubt the honour of Sir Joseph Wittoll.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; O Lord, sir.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; You are above, I&rsquo;m sure, a thought so low,
to suffer me to lose what was ventured in your service; nay,
&rsquo;twas in a manner paid down for your deliverance;
&rsquo;twas so much lent you.&nbsp; And you scorn, I&rsquo;ll say
that for you&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Nay, I&rsquo;ll say that for myself, with your
leave, sir, I do scorn a dirty thing.&nbsp; But, agad, I&rsquo;m
a little out of pocket at present.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Pshaw, you can&rsquo;t want a hundred
pound.&nbsp; Your word is sufficient anywhere.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
but borrowing so much dirt.&nbsp; You have large acres, and can
soon repay it.&nbsp; Money is but dirt, Sir Joseph&mdash;mere
dirt.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; But, I profess, &rsquo;tis a dirt I have washed
my hands of at present; I have laid it all out upon my Back.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Are you so extravagant in clothes, Sir
Joseph?</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha, a very good jest, I profess, ha, ha,
ha, a very good jest, and I did not know that I had said it, and
that&rsquo;s a better jest than t&rsquo;other.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a
sign you and I ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t been long acquainted; you have
lost a good jest for want of knowing me&mdash;I only mean a
friend of mine whom I call my Back; he sticks as close to me, and
follows me through all dangers&mdash;he is indeed back, breast,
and head-piece, as it were, to me.&nbsp; Agad, he&rsquo;s a brave
fellow.&nbsp; Pauh, I am quite another thing when I am with him:
I don&rsquo;t fear the devil (bless us) almost if he be by.&nbsp;
Ah! had he been with me last night&mdash;</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; If he had, sir, what then? he could have done no
more, nor perhaps have suffered so much.&nbsp; Had he a hundred
pound to lose?&nbsp; [<i>Angrily</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; O Lord, sir, by no means, but I might have saved
a hundred pound: I meant innocently, as I hope to be saved, sir
(a damned hot fellow), only, as I was saying, I let him have all
my ready money to redeem his great sword from limbo.&nbsp; But,
sir, I have a letter of credit to Alderman Fondlewife, as far as
two hundred pound, and this afternoon you shall see I am a
person, such a one as you would wish to have met with&mdash;</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; That you are, I&rsquo;ll be sworn.&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; Why, that&rsquo;s great and like
yourself.</p>

<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Oh, here a&rsquo; comes&mdash;Ay, my Hector of
Troy, welcome, my bully, my Back; agad, my heart has gone a pit
pat for thee.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; How now, my young knight?&nbsp; Not for fear, I
hope; he that knows me must be a stranger to fear.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Nay, agad, I hate fear ever since I had like to
have died of a fright.&nbsp; But&mdash;</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; But?&nbsp; Look you here, boy, here&rsquo;s your
antidote, here&rsquo;s your Jesuits&rsquo; powder for a shaking
fit.&nbsp; But who hast thou got with thee? is he of
mettle?&nbsp; [<i>Laying his hand upon his sword</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Ay, bully, a devilish smart fellow: &rsquo;a
will fight like a cock.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Say you so?&nbsp; Then I honour him.&nbsp; But
has he been abroad? for every cock will fight upon his own
dunghill.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;ll present
you&mdash;</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll recommend myself.&nbsp; Sir, I honour
you; I understand you love fighting, I reverence a man that loves
fighting.&nbsp; Sir, I kiss your hilts.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Sir, your servant, but you are misinformed, for,
unless it be to serve my particular friend, as Sir Joseph here,
my country, or my religion, or in some very justifiable cause,
I&rsquo;m not for it.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; O Lord, I beg your pardon, sir, I find you are
not of my palate: you can&rsquo;t relish a dish of fighting
without sweet sauce.&nbsp; Now, I think fighting for fighting
sake&rsquo;s sufficient cause; fighting to me&rsquo;s religion
and the laws.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Ah, well said, my Hero; was not that great, sir?
by the Lord Harry he says true; fighting is meat, drink, and
cloth to him.&nbsp; But, Back, this gentleman is one of the best
friends I have in the world, and saved my life last
night&mdash;you know I told you.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Ay!&nbsp; Then I honour him again.&nbsp; Sir, may
I crave your name?</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Ay, sir, my name&rsquo;s Sharper.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Pray, Mr. Sharper, embrace my Back.&nbsp; Very
well.&nbsp; By the Lord Harry, Mr. Sharper, he&rsquo;s as brave a
fellow as Cannibal, are not you, Bully-Back?</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Hannibal, I believe you mean, Sir Joseph.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Undoubtedly he did, sir; faith, Hannibal was a
very pretty fellow&mdash;but, Sir Joseph, comparisons are
odious&mdash;Hannibal was a very pretty fellow in those days, it
must be granted&mdash;but alas, sir! were he alive now, he would
be nothing, nothing in the earth.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; How, sir!&nbsp; I make a doubt if there be at
this day a greater general breathing.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Oh, excuse me, sir!&nbsp; Have you served abroad,
sir?</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Not I, really, sir.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Oh, I thought so.&nbsp; Why, then, you can know
nothing, sir: I am afraid you scarce know the history of the late
war in Flanders, with all its particulars.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Not I, sir, no more than public letters or
gazettes tell us.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Gazette!&nbsp; Why there again now.&nbsp; Why,
sir, there are not three words of truth the year round put into
the Gazette.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you a strange thing now as to
that.&nbsp; You must know, sir, I was resident in Flanders the
last campaign, had a small post there, but no matter for
that.&nbsp; Perhaps, sir, there was scarce anything of moment
done but an humble servant of yours, that shall be nameless, was
an eye-witness of.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t say had the greatest share
in&rsquo;t, though I might say that too, since I name nobody you
know.&nbsp; Well, Mr. Sharper, would you think it?&nbsp; In all
this time, as I hope for a truncheon, this rascally
gazette-writer never so much as once mentioned me&mdash;not once,
by the wars&mdash;took no more notice than as if Nol. Bluffe had
not been in the land of the living.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Strange!</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Yet, by the Lord Harry, &rsquo;tis true, Mr.
Sharper, for I went every day to coffee-houses to read the
gazette myself.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Ay, ay, no matter.&nbsp; You see, Mr. Sharper,
after all I am content to retire; live a private person.&nbsp;
Scipio and others have done it.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Impudent rogue.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Ay, this damned modesty of yours.&nbsp; Agad, if
he would put in for&rsquo;t he might be made general himself
yet.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Oh, fie! no, Sir Joseph; you know I hate
this.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Let me but tell Mr. Sharper a little, how you
ate fire once out of the mouth of a cannon.&nbsp; Agad, he did;
those impenetrable whiskers of his have confronted
flames&mdash;</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Death, what do you mean, Sir Joseph?</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Look you now.&nbsp; I tell you he&rsquo;s so
modest he&rsquo;ll own nothing.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Pish, you have put me out, I have forgot what I
was about.&nbsp; Pray hold your tongue, and give me leave.&nbsp;
[<i>Angrily</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; I am dumb.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; This sword I think I was telling you of, Mr.
Sharper.&nbsp; This sword I&rsquo;ll maintain to be the best
divine, anatomist, lawyer, or casuist in Europe; it shall decide
a controversy or split a cause&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Nay, now I must speak; it will split a hair, by
the Lord Harry, I have seen it.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Zounds, sir, it&rsquo;s a lie; you have not seen
it, nor sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t see it; sir, I say you can&rsquo;t
see; what d&rsquo;ye say to that now?</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; I am blind.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Death, had any other man interrupted
me&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Good Mr. Sharper, speak to him; I dare not look
that way.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Captain, Sir Joseph&rsquo;s penitent.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Oh, I am calm, sir, calm as a discharged
culverin.&nbsp; But &rsquo;twas indiscreet, when you know what
will provoke me.&nbsp; Nay, come, Sir Joseph, you know my
heat&rsquo;s soon over.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Well, I am a fool sometimes, but I&rsquo;m
sorry.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Enough.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Come, we&rsquo;ll go take a glass to drown
animosities.&nbsp; Mr. Sharper, will you partake?</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; I wait on you, sir.&nbsp; Nay, pray, Captain; you
are Sir Joseph&rsquo;s back.</p>

<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Ah! nay, dear; prithee, good, dear, sweet cousin,
no more.&nbsp; O Gad!&nbsp; I swear you&rsquo;d make one sick to
hear you.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Bless me! what have I said to move you thus?</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Oh, you have raved, talked idly, and all in
commendation of that filthy, awkward, two-legged creature
man.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;ve said; your
fever has transported you.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; If love be the fever which you mean, kind heaven
avert the cure.&nbsp; Let me have oil to feed that flame, and
never let it be extinct till I myself am ashes.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; There was a whine!&nbsp; O Gad, I hate your
horrid fancy.&nbsp; This love is the devil, and, sure, to be in
love is to be possessed.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis in the head, the heart,
the blood, the&mdash;all over.&nbsp; O Gad, you are quite
spoiled.&nbsp; I shall loathe the sight of mankind for your
sake.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Fie! this is gross affectation.&nbsp; A little of
Bellmour&rsquo;s company would change the scene.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Filthy fellow!&nbsp; I wonder, cousin&mdash;</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; I wonder, cousin, you should imagine I don&rsquo;t
perceive you love him.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Oh, I love your hideous fancy!&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha,
love a man!</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Love a man! yes, you would not love a beast.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Of all beasts not an ass&mdash;which is so like
your Vainlove.&nbsp; Lard, I have seen an ass look so chagrin,
ha, ha, ha (you must pardon me, I can&rsquo;t help laughing),
that an absolute lover would have concluded the poor creature to
have had darts, and flames, and altars, and all that in his
breast.&nbsp; Araminta, come, I&rsquo;ll talk seriously to you
now; could you but see with my eyes the buffoonery of one scene
of address, a lover, set out with all his equipage and
appurtenances; O Gad I sure you would&mdash;But you play the
game, and consequently can&rsquo;t see the miscarriages obvious
to every stander by.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Yes, yes; I can see something near it when you and
Bellmour meet.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know that you dreamt of
Bellmour last night, and called him aloud in your sleep.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Pish, I can&rsquo;t help dreaming of the devil
sometimes; would you from thence infer I love him?</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s not all; you caught me in your
arms when you named him, and pressed me to your bosom.&nbsp;
Sure, if I had not pinched you until you waked, you had stifled
me with kisses.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; O barbarous aspersion!</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; No aspersion, cousin, we are alone.&nbsp; Nay, I
can tell you more.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; I deny it all.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; What, before you hear it?</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; My denial is premeditated like your malice.&nbsp;
Lard, cousin, you talk oddly.&nbsp; Whatever the matter is, O my
Sol, I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll follow evil courses.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha, this is pleasant.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; You may laugh, but&mdash;</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; You think the malicious grin becomes you.&nbsp;
The devil take Bellmour.&nbsp; Why do you tell me of him?</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Oh, is it come out?&nbsp; Now you are angry, I am
sure you love him.&nbsp; I tell nobody else, cousin.&nbsp; I have
not betrayed you yet.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Prithee tell it all the world; it&rsquo;s
false.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Come, then, kiss and friends.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Pish.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Prithee don&rsquo;t be so peevish.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Prithee don&rsquo;t be so impertinent.&nbsp;
Betty!</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p>BETTY.&nbsp; Did your ladyship call, madam?</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Get my hoods and tippet, and bid the footman call
a chair.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; I hope you are not going out in dudgeon,
cousin.</p>
<h3>SCENE IV.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">[<i>To them</i>] <span

<p>FOOT.&nbsp; Madam, there are&mdash;</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Is there a chair?</p>
<p>FOOT.&nbsp; No, madam, there are Mr. Bellmour and Mr. Vainlove
to wait upon your ladyship.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Are they below?</p>
<p>FOOT.&nbsp; No, madam, they sent before, to know if you were
at home.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; The visit&rsquo;s to you, cousin; I suppose I am
at my liberty.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Be ready to show &rsquo;em up.</p>
<h3>SCENE V.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">[<i>To them</i>] <span
class="smcap">Betty</span>, <i>with Hoods and
Looking-glass</i>.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell, cousin; I believe we are equally
concerned.&nbsp; But if you continue your humour, it won&rsquo;t
be very entertaining.&nbsp; (I know she&rsquo;d fain be persuaded
to stay.)&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; I shall oblige you, in leaving you to the full

<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Let me see; hold the glass.&nbsp; Lard, I look
wretchedly to-day!</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Betty, why don&rsquo;t you help my cousin?&nbsp;
[<i>Putting on her hoods</i>.]</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Hold off your fists, and see that he gets a chair
with a high roof, or a very low seat.&nbsp; Stay, come back here,
you Mrs. Fidget&mdash;you are so ready to go to the
footman.&nbsp; Here, take &rsquo;em all again, my mind&rsquo;s
changed; I won&rsquo;t go.</p>
<h3>SCENE VI.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Araminta</span>, <span

<p>ARAM.&nbsp; So, this I expected.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t oblige
me, then, cousin, and let me have all the company to myself?</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; No; upon deliberation, I have too much charity to
trust you to yourself.&nbsp; The devil watches all opportunities;
and in this favourable disposition of your mind, heaven knows how
far you may be tempted: I am tender of your reputation.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; I am obliged to you.&nbsp; But who&rsquo;s
malicious now, Belinda?</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Not I; witness my heart, I stay out of pure
affection.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; In my conscience I believe you.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">[<i>To them</i>] <span
class="smcap">Vainlove</span>, <span

<p>BELL.&nbsp; So, fortune be praised!&nbsp; To find you both
within, ladies, is&mdash;</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; No miracle, I hope.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Not o&rsquo; your side, madam, I confess.&nbsp;
But my tyrant there and I, are two buckets that can never come
together.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Nor are ever like.&nbsp; Yet we often meet and
clash.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; How never like! marry, Hymen forbid.&nbsp; But
this it is to run so extravagantly in debt; I have laid out such
a world of love in your service, that you think you can never be
able to pay me all.&nbsp; So shun me for the same reason that you
would a dun.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Ay, on my conscience, and the most impertinent
and troublesome of duns&mdash;a dun for money will be quiet, when
he sees his debtor has not wherewithal.&nbsp; But a dun for love
is an eternal torment that never rests&mdash;</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Until he has created love where there was none,
and then gets it for his pains.&nbsp; For importunity in love,
like importunity at Court, first creates its own interest and
then pursues it for the favour.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Favours that are got by impudence and importunity,
are like discoveries from the rack, when the afflicted person,
for his ease, sometimes confesses secrets his heart knows nothing
of.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; I should rather think favours, so gained, to be
due rewards to indefatigable devotion.&nbsp; For as love is a
deity, he must be served by prayer.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; O Gad, would you would all pray to love, then,
and let us alone.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; You are the temples of love, and &rsquo;tis
through you, our devotion must be conveyed.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Rather poor silly idols of your own making, which
upon the least displeasure you forsake and set up new.&nbsp;
Every man now changes his mistress and his religion as his humour
varies, or his interest.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; O madam&mdash;</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Nay, come, I find we are growing serious, and then
we are in great danger of being dull.&nbsp; If my music-master be
not gone, I&rsquo;ll entertain you with a new song, which comes
pretty near my own opinion of love and your sex.&nbsp;
Who&rsquo;s there?&nbsp; Is Mr. Gavot gone?&nbsp;

<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Prithee hold thy tongue.&nbsp; Lard, he has so
pestered me with flames and stuff, I think I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
endure the sight of a fire this twelvemonth.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Yet all can&rsquo;t melt that cruel frozen
heart.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; O Gad, I hate your hideous fancy&mdash;you said
that once before&mdash;if you must talk impertinently, for
Heaven&rsquo;s sake let it be with variety; don&rsquo;t come
always, like the devil, wrapt in flames.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not
hear a sentence more, that begins with an &lsquo;I
burn&rsquo;&mdash;or an &lsquo;I beseech you, madam.&rsquo;</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; But tell me how you would be adored.&nbsp; I am
very tractable.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Then know, I would be adored in silence.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Humph, I thought so, that you might have all the
talk to yourself.&nbsp; You had better let me speak; for if my
thoughts fly to any pitch, I shall make villainous signs.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; What will you get by that; to make such signs as
I won&rsquo;t understand?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Ay, but if I&rsquo;m tongue-tied, I must have all
my actions free to&mdash;quicken your apprehension&mdash;and
I&mdash;gad let me tell you, my most prevailing argument is
expressed in dumb show.</p>

hearing.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll bring my cousin.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Faith, madam, I dare not speak to her, but
I&rsquo;ll make signs.&nbsp; [<i>Addresses Belinda in dumb

than your talking impertinence, as an ape is a much more
troublesome animal than a parrot.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Ay, cousin, and &rsquo;tis a sign the creatures
mimic nature well; for there are few men but do more silly things
than they say.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Well, I find my apishness has paid the ransom for
my speech, and set it at liberty&mdash;though, I confess, I could
be well enough pleased to drive on a love-bargain in that silent
manner&mdash;&rsquo;twould save a man a world of lying and
swearing at the year&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; Besides, I have had a

<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Will he not come, then?</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Yes, yes; come, I warrant him, if you will go in
and be ready to receive him.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Why did you not tell me?&nbsp; Whom mean you?</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Whom you should mean, Heartwell.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Senseless creature, I meant my Vainlove.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; You may as soon hope to recover your own
maiden-head as his love.&nbsp; Therefore, e&rsquo;en set your
heart at rest, and in the name of opportunity mind your own
business.&nbsp; Strike Heartwell home before the bait&rsquo;s
worn off the hook.&nbsp; Age will come.&nbsp; He nibbled fairly
yesterday, and no doubt will be eager enough to-day to swallow
the temptation.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Well, since there&rsquo;s no remedy&mdash;yet tell
me&mdash;for I would know, though to the anguish of my soul, how
did he refuse?&nbsp; Tell me, how did he receive my
letter&mdash;in anger or in scorn?</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Neither; but what was ten times worse, with damned
senseless indifference.&nbsp; By this light I could have spit in
his face.&nbsp; Receive it!&nbsp; Why, he received it as I would
one of your lovers that should come empty-handed; as a court lord
does his mercer&rsquo;s bill or a begging dedication&mdash;he
received it as if &rsquo;t had been a letter from his wife.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; What! did he not read it?</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Hummed it over, gave you his respects, and said he
would take time to peruse it&mdash;but then he was in haste.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Respects, and peruse it!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s gone,
and Araminta has bewitched him from me.&nbsp; Oh, how the name of
rival fires my blood.&nbsp; I could curse &rsquo;em both; eternal
jealousy attend her love, and disappointment meet his.&nbsp; Oh
that I could revenge the torment he has caused; methinks I feel
the woman strong within me, and vengeance kindles in the room of
love.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; I have that in my head may make mischief.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; How, dear Lucy?</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; You know Araminta&rsquo;s dissembled coyness has
won, and keeps him hers&mdash;</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Could we persuade him that she loves
another&mdash;</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; No, you&rsquo;re out; could we persuade him that
she dotes on him, himself.&nbsp; Contrive a kind letter as from
her, &rsquo;twould disgust his nicety, and take away his
stomach.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Impossible; &rsquo;twill never take.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Trouble not your head.&nbsp; Let me alone&mdash;I
will inform myself of what passed between &rsquo;em to-day, and
about it straight.&nbsp; Hold, I&rsquo;m mistaken, or
that&rsquo;s Heartwell, who stands talking at the
corner&mdash;&rsquo;tis he&mdash;go get you in, madam, receive
him pleasantly, dress up your face in innocence and smiles, and
dissemble the very want of dissimulation.&nbsp; You know what
will take him.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis as hard to counterfeit love as it is to
conceal it: but I&rsquo;ll do my weak endeavour, though I fear I
have not art.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Hang art, madam, and trust to nature for
dissembling.</p>

Silvia&rsquo;s house, the cave of that enchantress, and which
consequently I ought to shun as I would infection?&nbsp; To enter

of a fever, and in some raving fit, be led to plunge myself into
that more consuming fire, a woman&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp; Ha! well

could I curse myself, yet cannot repent.&nbsp; O thou delicious,
damned, dear, destructive woman!&nbsp; S&rsquo;death, how the
young fellows will hoot me!&nbsp; I shall be the jest of the
town: nay, in two days I expect to be chronicled in ditty, and
sung in woful ballad, to the tune of the Superannuated
Maiden&rsquo;s Comfort, or the Bachelor&rsquo;s Fall; and upon
the third, I shall be hanged in effigy, pasted up for the

peace.&nbsp; I should not esteem a pardon if too easily won.</p>

<p>SETTER.&nbsp; Rather prepare her for confession, sir, by
helping her to sin.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Be at your master&rsquo;s lodging in the evening;
I shall use the robes.</p>

<p>SETTER.&nbsp; I shall, sir.&nbsp; I wonder to which of these
two gentlemen I do most properly appertain: the one uses me as
his attendant; the other (being the better acquainted with my
parts) employs me as a pimp; why, that&rsquo;s much the more
honourable employment&mdash;by all means.&nbsp; I follow one as
my master, the other follows me as his conductor.</p>
<h3>SCENE VI.</h3>

<p>LUCY.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s the hang-dog, his man&mdash;I had a
power over him in the reign of my mistress; but he is too true a
<i>Valet de Chambre</i> not to affect his master&rsquo;s faults,
and consequently is revolted from his allegiance.</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; Undoubtedly &rsquo;tis impossible to be a pimp
and not a man of parts.&nbsp; That is without being politic,
diligent, secret, wary, and so forth&mdash;and to all this
valiant as Hercules&mdash;that is, passively valiant and actively
obedient.&nbsp; Ah, Setter, what a treasure is here lost for want
of being known.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s some villainy afoot; he&rsquo;s so
thoughtful.&nbsp; May be I may discover something in my
mask.&nbsp; Worthy sir, a word with you.&nbsp; [<i>Puts on her
mask</i>.]</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; Why, if I were known, I might come to be a great
man&mdash;</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Not to interrupt your meditation&mdash;</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; And I should not be the first that has procured
his greatness by pimping.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Now poverty and the pox light upon thee for a
contemplative pimp.</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; Ha! what art who thus maliciously hast awakened
me from my dream of glory?&nbsp; Speak, thou vile
disturber&mdash;</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Of thy most vile cogitations&mdash;thou poor,
conceited wretch, how wert thou valuing thyself upon thy
master&rsquo;s employment?&nbsp; For he&rsquo;s the head pimp to
Mr. Bellmour.</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; Good words, damsel, or I shall&mdash;But how
dost thou know my master or me?</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Yes; I know both master and man to be&mdash;</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; To be men, perhaps; nay, faith, like enough: I
often march in the rear of my master, and enter the breaches
which he has made.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Ay, the breach of faith, which he has begun: thou
traitor to thy lawful princess.</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; Why, how now! prithee who art?&nbsp; Lay by that
worldly face and produce your natural vizor.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; No, sirrah, I&rsquo;ll keep it on to abuse thee
and leave thee without hopes of revenge.</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I begin to smoke ye: thou art some
forsaken Abigail we have dallied with heretofore&mdash;and art
come to tickle thy imagination with remembrance of iniquity
past.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; No thou pitiful flatterer of thy master&rsquo;s
imperfections; thou maukin made up of the shreds and parings of
his superfluous fopperies.</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; Thou art thy mistress&rsquo;s foul self,
composed of her sullied iniquities and clothing.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Hang thee, beggar&rsquo;s cur, thy master is but a
mumper in love, lies canting at the gate; but never dares presume
to enter the house.</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; Thou art the wicket to thy mistress&rsquo;s
gate, to be opened for all comers.&nbsp; In fine thou art the
highroad to thy mistress.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Beast, filthy toad, I can hold no longer, look and
tremble.&nbsp; [<i>Unmasks</i>.]</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; How, Mrs. Lucy!</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; I wonder thou hast the impudence to look me in the
face.</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; Adsbud, who&rsquo;s in fault, mistress of mine?
who flung the first stone? who undervalued my function? and who
the devil could know you by instinct?</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; You could know my office by instinct, and be
hanged, which you have slandered most abominably.&nbsp; It vexes
me not what you said of my person; but that my innocent calling
should be exposed and scandalised&mdash;I cannot bear it.</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; Nay, faith, Lucy, I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;ll
own myself to blame, though we were both in fault as to our
offices&mdash;come, I&rsquo;ll make you any reparation.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Swear.</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; I do swear to the utmost of my power.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; To be brief, then; what is the reason your master
did not appear to-day according to the summons I brought him?</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; To answer you as briefly&mdash;he has a cause to
be tried in another court.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Come, tell me in plain terms, how forward he is
with Araminta.</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; Too forward to be turned back&mdash;though
he&rsquo;s a little in disgrace at present about a kiss which he
forced.&nbsp; You and I can kiss, Lucy, without all that.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Stand off&mdash;he&rsquo;s a precious jewel.</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; And therefore you&rsquo;d have him to set in
your lady&rsquo;s locket.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Where is he now?</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll be in the Piazza presently.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Remember to-day&rsquo;s behaviour.&nbsp; Let me
see you with a penitent face.</p>
<p>SETTER.&nbsp; What, no token of amity, Lucy?&nbsp; You and I
don&rsquo;t use to part with dry lips.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; No, no, avaunt&mdash;I&rsquo;ll not be slabbered
and kissed now&mdash;I&rsquo;m not i&rsquo; th&rsquo; humour.</p>

note.&nbsp; Go, and bring it me hither.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll stay
here for you.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; You may stay until the day of judgment, then, by
the Lord Harry.&nbsp; I know better things than to be run through
the guts for a hundred pounds.&nbsp; Why, I gave that hundred
pound for being saved, and de&rsquo;e think, an there were no
danger, I&rsquo;ll be so ungrateful to take it from the gentleman
again?</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Well, go to him from me&mdash;tell him, I say, he
must refund&mdash;or Bilbo&rsquo;s the world, and slaughter will
ensue.&nbsp; If he refuse, tell him&mdash;but whisper
that&mdash;tell him&mdash;I&rsquo;ll pink his soul.&nbsp; But
whisper that softly to him.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; So softly that he shall never hear on&rsquo;t, I
warrant you.&nbsp; Why, what a devil&rsquo;s the matter, Bully;
are you mad? or de&rsquo;e think I&rsquo;m mad?&nbsp; Agad, for
my part, I don&rsquo;t love to be the messenger of ill news;
&rsquo;tis an ungrateful office&mdash;so tell him yourself.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; By these hilts I believe he frightened you into
this composition: I believe you gave it him out of fear, pure,
paltry fear&mdash;confess.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; No, no, hang&rsquo;t; I was not afraid
neither&mdash;though I confess he did in a manner snap me
up&mdash;yet I can&rsquo;t say that it was altogether out of
fear, but partly to prevent mischief&mdash;for he was a devilish
choleric fellow.&nbsp; And if my choler had been up too, agad,
there would have been mischief done, that&rsquo;s flat.&nbsp; And
yet I believe if you had been by, I would as soon have let him
a&rsquo; had a hundred of my teeth.&nbsp; Adsheart, if he should

<p>HEART.&nbsp; Well has this prevailed for me, and will you look
upon me?</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; If you could sing and dance so, I should love to
look upon you too.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Why, &rsquo;twas I sung and danced; I gave music
to the voice, and life to their measures.&nbsp; Look you here,
Silvia, [<i>pulling out a purse and chinking it</i>] here are
songs and dances, poetry and music&mdash;hark! how sweetly one
guinea rhymes to another&mdash;and how they dance to the music of
their own chink.&nbsp; This buys all t&rsquo;other&mdash;and this
thou shalt have; this, and all that I am worth, for the purchase
of thy love.&nbsp; Say, is it mine then, ha?&nbsp; Speak,
Syren&mdash;Oons, why do I look on her!&nbsp; Yet I must.&nbsp;
Speak, dear angel, devil, saint, witch; do not rack me with
suspense.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Nay, don&rsquo;t stare at me so.&nbsp; You make me
blush&mdash;I cannot look.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; O manhood, where art thou?&nbsp; What am I come
to?&nbsp; A woman&rsquo;s toy, at these years!&nbsp; Death, a
bearded baby for a girl to dandle.&nbsp; O dotage, dotage!&nbsp;
That ever that noble passion, lust, should ebb to this
degree.&nbsp; No reflux of vigorous blood: but milky love
supplies the empty channels; and prompts me to the softness of a
child&mdash;a mere infant and would suck.&nbsp; Can you love me,
Silvia?&nbsp; Speak.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; I dare not speak until I believe you, and indeed
I&rsquo;m afraid to believe you yet.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Death, how her innocence torments and pleases
me!&nbsp; Lying, child, is indeed the art of love, and men are
generally masters in it: but I&rsquo;m so newly entered, you
cannot distrust me of any skill in the treacherous mystery.&nbsp;
Now, by my soul, I cannot lie, though it were to serve a friend
or gain a mistress.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Must you lie, then, if you say you love me?</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; No, no, dear ignorance, thou beauteous
changeling&mdash;I tell thee I do love thee, and tell it for a
truth, a naked truth, which I&rsquo;m ashamed to discover.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; But love, they say, is a tender thing, that will
smooth frowns, and make calm an angry face; will soften a rugged
temper, and make ill-humoured people good.&nbsp; You look ready
to fright one, and talk as if your passion were not love, but
anger.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis both; for I am angry with myself when
I am pleased with you.&nbsp; And a pox upon me for loving thee so
well&mdash;yet I must on.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a bearded arrow, and
will more easily be thrust forward than drawn back.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Indeed, if I were well assured you loved; but how
can I be well assured?</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Take the symptoms&mdash;and ask all the tyrants
of thy sex if their fools are not known by this party-coloured
livery.&nbsp; I am melancholic when thou art absent; look like an
ass when thou art present; wake for thee when I should sleep; and
even dream of thee when I am awake; sigh much, drink little, eat
less, court solitude, am grown very entertaining to myself, and
(as I am informed) very troublesome to everybody else.&nbsp; If
this be not love, it is madness, and then it is pardonable.&nbsp;
Nay, yet a more certain sign than all this, I give thee my
money.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Ay, but that is no sign; for they say, gentlemen
will give money to any naughty woman to come to bed to
them.&nbsp; O Gemini, I hope you don&rsquo;t mean so&mdash;for I
won&rsquo;t be a whore.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; The more is the pity.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Nay, if you would marry me, you should not come to
bed to me&mdash;you have such a beard, and would so prickle
one.&nbsp; But do you intend to marry me?</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; That a fool should ask such a malicious
question!&nbsp; Death, I shall be drawn in before I know where I
am.&nbsp; However, I find I am pretty sure of her consent, if I
am put to it.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; Marry you?&nbsp; No,
no, I&rsquo;ll love you.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Nay, but if you love me, you must marry me.&nbsp;
What, don&rsquo;t I know my father loved my mother and was
married to her?</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Ay, ay, in old days people married where they
loved; but that fashion is changed, child.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Never tell me that; I know it is not changed by
myself: for I love you, and would marry you.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have my beard shaved, it
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t hurt thee, and we&rsquo;ll go to
bed&mdash;</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; No, no, I&rsquo;m not such a fool neither, but I
can keep myself honest.&nbsp; Here, I won&rsquo;t keep anything
that&rsquo;s yours; I hate you now, [<i>throws the purse</i>] and
I&rsquo;ll never see you again, &rsquo;cause you&rsquo;d have me
be naught.&nbsp; [<i>Going</i>.]</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Damn her, let her go, and a good riddance.&nbsp;
Yet so much tenderness and beauty and honesty together is a
jewel.&nbsp; Stay, Silvia&mdash;But then to marry; why, every man
plays the fool once in his life.&nbsp; But to marry is playing
the fool all one&rsquo;s life long.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; What did you call me for?</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give thee all I have, and thou shalt
live with me in everything so like my wife, the world shall
believe it.&nbsp; Nay, thou shalt think so thyself&mdash;only let
me not think so.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; No, I&rsquo;ll die before I&rsquo;ll be your
whore&mdash;as well as I love you.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; A woman, and ignorant, may
be honest, when &rsquo;tis out of obstinacy and
contradiction.&nbsp; But, s&rsquo;death, it is but a may be, and
upon scurvy terms.&nbsp; Well, farewell then&mdash;if I can get
out of sight I may get the better of myself.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; Well&mdash;good-bye.&nbsp; [<i>Turns and

<p>HEART.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Nay, come, we&rsquo;ll kiss at
parting.&nbsp; [<i>Kisses her</i>.]&nbsp; By heaven, her kiss is
sweeter than liberty.&nbsp; I will marry thee.&nbsp; There, thou
hast done&rsquo;t.&nbsp; All my resolves melted in that
kiss&mdash;one more.</p>
<p>SILV.&nbsp; But when?</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m impatient until it be done; I will not
give myself liberty to think, lest I should cool.&nbsp; I will
about a licence straight&mdash;in the evening expect me.&nbsp;

I was obstinate and doting; so that my inclination was (and is
still) greater than my power.&nbsp; And will not that which
tempted thee, also tempt others, who will tempt her, Isaac?&nbsp;
I fear it much.&nbsp; But does not thy wife love thee, nay, dote
upon thee?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Why then!&nbsp; Ay, but to say truth,
she&rsquo;s fonder of me than she has reason to be; and in the
way of trade, we still suspect the smoothest dealers of the
deepest designs.&nbsp; And that she has some designs deeper than
thou canst reach, thou hast experimented, Isaac.&nbsp; But,
mum.</p>

<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; I hope my dearest jewel is not going to leave
me&mdash;are you, Nykin?</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Wife&mdash;have you thoroughly considered how
detestable, how heinous, and how crying a sin the sin of adultery
is?&nbsp; Have you weighed it, I say?&nbsp; For it is a very
weighty sin; and although it may lie heavy upon thee, yet thy
husband must also bear his part.&nbsp; For thy iniquity will fall
upon his head.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Bless me, what means my dear?</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; I profess she has an
alluring eye; I am doubtful whether I shall trust her, even with
Tribulation himself.&nbsp; Speak, I say, have you considered what
it is to cuckold your husband?</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;m amazed.&nbsp;
Sure he has discovered nothing.&nbsp; Who has wronged me to my
dearest?&nbsp; I hope my jewel does not think that ever I had any
such thing in my head, or ever will have.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; No, no, I tell you I shall have it in my
head&mdash;</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; I know not what to
think.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m resolved to find the meaning of
it.&nbsp; Unkind dear!&nbsp; Was it for this you sent to call
me?&nbsp; Is it not affliction enough that you are to leave me,
but you must study to increase it by unjust suspicions?&nbsp;
[<i>Crying</i>.]&nbsp; Well&mdash;well&mdash;you know my
fondness, and you love to tyrannise&mdash;Go on, cruel man, do:
triumph over my poor heart while it holds, which cannot be long,
with this usage of yours.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s what you
want.&nbsp; Well, you will have your ends soon.&nbsp; You
will&mdash;you will.&nbsp; Yes, it will break to oblige
you.&nbsp; [<i>Sighs</i>.]</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Verily, I fear I have carried the jest too
far.&nbsp; Nay, look you now if she does not
weep&mdash;&rsquo;tis the fondest fool.&nbsp; Nay, Cocky, Cocky,
nay, dear Cocky, don&rsquo;t cry, I was but in jest, I was not,
ifeck.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; Oh then, all&rsquo;s
safe.&nbsp; I was terribly frighted.&nbsp; My affliction is
always your jest, barbarous man!&nbsp; Oh, that I should love to
this degree!&nbsp; Yet&mdash;</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Nay, Cocky.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; No, no, you are weary of me, that&rsquo;s
it&mdash;that&rsquo;s all, you would get another
wife&mdash;another fond fool, to break her heart&mdash;Well, be
as cruel as you can to me, I&rsquo;ll pray for you; and when I am
dead with grief, may you have one that will love you as well as I
have done: I shall be contented to lie at peace in my cold
grave&mdash;since it will please you.&nbsp; [<i>Sighs</i>.]</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Good lack, good lack, she would melt a heart of
oak&mdash;I profess I can hold no longer.&nbsp; Nay, dear
Cocky&mdash;ifeck, you&rsquo;ll break my heart&mdash;ifeck you
will.&nbsp; See, you have made me weep&mdash;made poor Nykin
weep.&nbsp; Nay, come kiss, buss poor Nykin&mdash;and I
won&rsquo;t leave thee&mdash;I&rsquo;ll lose all first.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; How!&nbsp; Heaven
forbid! that will be carrying the jest too far indeed.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you kiss Nykin?</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Go, naughty Nykin, you don&rsquo;t love
me.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Kiss, kiss, ifeck, I do.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; No, you don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; [<i>She kisses
him</i>.]</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; What, not love Cocky!</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; No-h.&nbsp; [<i>Sighs</i>.]</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; I profess I do love thee better than five hundred
pound&mdash;and so thou shalt say, for I&rsquo;ll leave it to
stay with thee.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; No you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t neglect your
business for me.&nbsp; No, indeed, you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t,
Nykin.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t go, I&rsquo;ll think you been
dealous of me still.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; He, he, he, wilt thou, poor fool?&nbsp; Then I
will go, I won&rsquo;t be dealous.&nbsp; Poor Cocky, kiss Nykin,
kiss Nykin, ee, ee, ee.&nbsp; Here will be the good man anon, to
talk to Cocky and teach her how a wife ought to behave
herself.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; I hope to have one that
will show me how a husband ought to behave himself.&nbsp; I shall
be glad to learn, to please my jewel.&nbsp; [<i>Kiss</i>.]</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my good dear.&nbsp; Come, kiss Nykin
once more, and then get you in.&nbsp; So&mdash;get you in, get
you in.&nbsp; Bye, bye.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Bye, Nykin.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Bye, Cocky.</p>

<p>SHARP.&nbsp; [<i>Reads</i>.]&nbsp; Hum, hum!&nbsp; And what
then appeared a fault, upon reflection seems only an effect of a
too powerful passion.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid I give too great a
proof of my own at this time.&nbsp; I am in disorder for what I
have written.&nbsp; But something, I know not what, forced
me.&nbsp; I only beg a favourable censure of this and your <span
class="smcap">Araminta</span>.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Lost!&nbsp; Pray heaven thou hast not lost thy
wits.&nbsp; Here, here, she&rsquo;s thy own, man, signed and
sealed too.&nbsp; To her, man&mdash;a delicious melon, pure and
consenting ripe, and only waits thy cutting up: she has been
breeding love to thee all this while, and just now she&rsquo;s
delivered of it.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis an untimely fruit, and she has
miscarried of her love.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Never leave this damned ill-natured whimsey,
Frank?&nbsp; Thou hast a sickly, peevish appetite; only chew love
and cannot digest it.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Yes, when I feed myself.&nbsp; But I hate to be
crammed.&nbsp; By heaven, there&rsquo;s not a woman will give a
man the pleasure of a chase: my sport is always balked or cut
short.&nbsp; I stumble over the game I would pursue.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis dull and unnatural to have a hare run full in the
hounds&rsquo; mouth, and would distaste the keenest hunter.&nbsp;
I would have overtaken, not have met, my game.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; However, I hope you don&rsquo;t mean to forsake
it; that will be but a kind of mongrel cur&rsquo;s trick.&nbsp;
Well, are you for the Mall?</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; No; she will be there this evening.&nbsp; Yes, I
will go too, and she shall see her error in&mdash;</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; In her choice, I-gad.&nbsp; But thou canst not be
so great a brute as to slight her.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; I should disappoint her if I did not.&nbsp; By her
management I should think she expects it.</p>

face, and he has betrayed me to him.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; You are surprised.&nbsp; Did you not expect a
lover, madam?&nbsp; Those eyes shone kindly on my first
appearance, though now they are o&rsquo;ercast.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; I may well be surprised at your person and
impudence: they are both new to me.&nbsp; You are not what your
first appearance promised: the piety of your habit was welcome,
but not the hypocrisy.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Rather the hypocrisy was welcome, but not the
hypocrite.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Who are you, sir?&nbsp; You have mistaken the
house sure.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; I have directions in my pocket which agree with
everything but your unkindness.&nbsp; [<i>Pulls out the

&rsquo;tis too late to dissemble.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis plain, then, you have mistaken the person.&nbsp;
[<i>Going</i>.]</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; If we part so I&rsquo;m mistaken.&nbsp; Hold,
hold, madam!&nbsp; I confess I have run into an error.&nbsp; I
beg your pardon a thousand times.&nbsp; What an eternal blockhead
am I!&nbsp; Can you forgive me the disorder I have put you
into?&nbsp; But it is a mistake which anybody might have
made.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; What can this mean?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
impossible he should be mistaken after all this.&nbsp; A handsome
fellow if he had not surprised me.&nbsp; Methinks, now I look on
him again, I would not have him mistaken.&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; We are all liable to mistakes, sir.&nbsp;
If you own it to be so, there needs no farther apology.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Nay, faith, madam, &rsquo;tis a pleasant one, and
worth your hearing.&nbsp; Expecting a friend last night, at his
lodgings, till &rsquo;twas late, my intimacy with him gave me the
freedom of his bed.&nbsp; He not coming home all night, a letter
was delivered to me by a servant in the morning.&nbsp; Upon the
perusal I found the contents so charming that I could think of
nothing all day but putting &rsquo;em in practice, until just
now, the first time I ever looked upon the superscription, I am
the most surprised in the world to find it directed to Mr.
Vainlove.&nbsp; Gad, madam, I ask you a million of pardons, and
will make you any satisfaction.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; I am discovered.&nbsp; And either Vainlove is
not guilty, or he has handsomely excused him.&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; You appear concerned, madam.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; I hope you are a gentleman;&mdash;and since
you are privy to a weak woman&rsquo;s failing, won&rsquo;t turn
it to the prejudice of her reputation.&nbsp; You look as if you
had more honour&mdash;</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; And more love, or my face is a false witness and
deserves to be pilloried.&nbsp; No, by heaven, I swear&mdash;</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Nay, don&rsquo;t swear if you&rsquo;d have me
believe you; but promise&mdash;</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Well, I promise.&nbsp; A promise is so cold: give
me leave to swear, by those eyes, those killing eyes, by those
healing lips.&nbsp; Oh! press the soft charm close to mine, and
seal &rsquo;em up for ever.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Upon that condition.&nbsp; [<i>He kisses

<p>BELL.&nbsp; Eternity was in that moment.&nbsp; One more, upon
any condition!</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Nay, now&mdash;I never saw anything so
agreeably impudent.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you
censure me for this, now?&mdash;but &rsquo;tis to buy your
silence.&nbsp; [<i>Kiss</i>.]&nbsp; Oh, but what am I doing!</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Doing!&nbsp; No tongue can express it&mdash;not
thy own, nor anything, but thy lips.&nbsp; I am faint with the
excess of bliss.&nbsp; Oh, for love-sake, lead me anywhither,
where I may lie down&mdash;quickly, for I&rsquo;m afraid I shall
have a fit.</p>

<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Lard, my dear, I am glad I have met you; I have
been at the Exchange since, and am so tired&mdash;</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Why, what&rsquo;s the matter?</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Oh the most inhuman, barbarous
hackney-coach!&nbsp; I am jolted to a jelly.&nbsp; Am I not
horribly touzed?&nbsp; [<i>Pulls out a pocket-glass</i>.]</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Your head&rsquo;s a little out of order.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; A little!&nbsp; O frightful!&nbsp; What a furious
phiz I have!&nbsp; O most rueful!&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha.&nbsp; O Gad,
I hope nobody will come this way, till I have put myself a little
in repair.&nbsp; Ah! my dear, I have seen such unhewn creatures
since.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t for my soul help
thinking that I look just like one of &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Good dear,
pin this, and I&rsquo;ll tell you&mdash;very well&mdash;so, thank
you, my dear&mdash;but as I was telling you&mdash;pish, this is
the untowardest lock&mdash;so, as I was telling you&mdash;how
d&rsquo;ye like me now?&nbsp; Hideous, ha?&nbsp; Frightful
still?&nbsp; Or how?</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; No, no; you&rsquo;re very well as can be.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; And so&mdash;but where did I leave off, my
dear?&nbsp; I was telling you&mdash;</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; You were about to tell me something, child, but
you left off before you began.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Oh; a most comical sight: a country squire, with
the equipage of a wife and two daughters, came to Mrs.
Snipwel&rsquo;s shop while I was there&mdash;but oh Gad! two such
unlicked cubs!</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; I warrant, plump, cherry-cheeked country
girls.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Ay, o&rsquo; my conscience, fat as barn-door
fowl: but so bedecked, you would have taken &rsquo;em for
Friesland hens, with their feathers growing the wrong way.&nbsp;
O such outlandish creatures!&nbsp; Such Tramontan&aelig;, and
foreigners to the fashion, or anything in practice!&nbsp; I had
not patience to behold.&nbsp; I undertook the modelling of one of
their fronts, the more modern structure&mdash;</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; Bless me, cousin; why would you affront anybody
so?&nbsp; They might be gentlewomen of a very good
family&mdash;</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Of a very ancient one, I dare swear, by their
dress.&nbsp; Affront! pshaw, how you&rsquo;re mistaken!&nbsp; The
poor creature, I warrant, was as full of curtsies, as if I had
been her godmother.&nbsp; The truth on&rsquo;t is, I did
endeavour to make her look like a Christian&mdash;and she was
sensible of it, for she thanked me, and gave me two apples,
piping hot, out of her under-petticoat pocket.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha:
and t&rsquo;other did so stare and gape, I fancied her like the
front of her father&rsquo;s hall; her eyes were the two
jut-windows, and her mouth the great door, most hospitably kept
open for the entertainment of travelling flies.</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; So then, you have been diverted.&nbsp; What did
they buy?</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Why, the father bought a powder-horn, and an
almanac, and a comb-case; the mother, a great fruz-towr, and a
fat amber necklace; the daughters only tore two pairs of
kid-leather gloves, with trying &rsquo;em on.&nbsp; O Gad, here

<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Faith, madam, the talent was born with

bloody-minded traitor!</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Hey-day!&nbsp; Traitor yourself.&nbsp; By the

my dear, I have been in such a fright, that I forgot to tell you,
poor Mr. Spintext has a sad fit of the colic, and is forced to

Here&rsquo;s doctrine!&nbsp; Ay, here&rsquo;s discipline!</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Dear husband, I&rsquo;m amazed.&nbsp; Sure it
is a good book, and only tends to the speculation of sin.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Speculation!&nbsp; No no; something went farther
than speculation when I was not to be let in.&mdash;Where is this
apocryphal elder?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll ferret him.</p>

<p>FOND.&nbsp; Indeed, and I have horns, dear.&nbsp; The devil,
no, I am afraid &rsquo;tis the flesh, thou harlot.&nbsp; Dear,
with the pox.&nbsp; Come Syren, speak, confess, who is this
reverend, brawny pastor.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Indeed, and indeed now, my dear Nykin, I
never saw this wicked man before.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Oh, it is a man then, it seems.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Rather, sure it is a wolf in the clothing of
a sheep.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Thou art a devil in his proper
clothing&mdash;woman&rsquo;s flesh.&nbsp; What, you know nothing
of him, but his fleece here!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t love mutton?
you Magdalen unconverted.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Well, now, I know my cue.&mdash;That is, very
honourably to excuse her, and very impudently accuse
myself.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Why then, I wish I may never enter into the
heaven of your embraces again, my dear, if ever I saw his face
before.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; O Lord!&nbsp; O strange!&nbsp; I am in admiration
of your impudence.&nbsp; Look at him a little better; he is more
modest, I warrant you, than to deny it.&nbsp; Come, were you two
never face to face before?&nbsp; Speak.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Since all artifice is vain.&nbsp; And I think
myself obliged to speak the truth in justice to your
wife.&mdash;No.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Humph.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; No, indeed, dear.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Nay, I find you are both in a story; that I must
confess.&nbsp; But, what&mdash;not to be cured of the
colic?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know your patient, Mrs. Quack?&nbsp;
Oh, &lsquo;lie upon your stomach; lying upon your stomach will
cure you of the colic.&rsquo;&nbsp; Ah! answer me, Jezebel?</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Let the wicked man answer for himself: does
he think I have nothing to do but excuse him? &rsquo;tis enough
if I can clear my own innocence to my own dear.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; By my troth, and so &rsquo;tis.&nbsp; I have been
a little too backward; that&rsquo;s the truth on&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Come, sir, who are you, in the first place?&nbsp;
And what are you?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; A whore-master.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Very concise.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; O beastly, impudent creature.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Well, sir, and what came you hither for?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; To lie with your wife.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Good again.&nbsp; A very civil person this, and I
believe speaks truth.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Oh, insupportable impudence.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Well, sir; pray be covered&mdash;and you
have&mdash;Heh!&nbsp; You have finished the matter, heh?&nbsp;
And I am, as I should be, a sort of civil perquisite to a
whore-master, called a cuckold, heh?&nbsp; Is it not so?&nbsp;
Come, I&rsquo;m inclining to believe every word you say.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Why, faith, I must confess, so I designed you; but
you were a little unlucky in coming so soon, and hindered the
making of your own fortune.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Humph.&nbsp; Nay, if you mince the matter once and
go back of your word you are not the person I took you for.&nbsp;
Come, come, go on boldly.&mdash;What, don&rsquo;t be ashamed of
your profession.&mdash;Confess, confess; I shall love thee the
better for&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I shall, i&rsquo;feck.&nbsp; What, dost
think I don&rsquo;t know how to behave myself in the employment
of a cuckold, and have been three years apprentice to
matrimony?&nbsp; Come, come; plain dealing is a jewel.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Well, since I see thou art a good, honest fellow,
I&rsquo;ll confess the whole matter to thee.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Oh, I am a very honest fellow.&nbsp; You never lay
with an honester man&rsquo;s wife in your life.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; How my heart aches!&nbsp; All my comfort lies
in his impudence, and heaven be praised, he has a considerable
portion.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; In short, then, I was informed of the opportunity
of your absence by my spy (for faith, honest Isaac, I have a long
time designed thee this favour).&nbsp; I knew Spintext was to
come by your direction.&nbsp; But I laid a trap for him, and
procured his habit, in which I passed upon your servants, and was
conducted hither.&nbsp; I pretended a fit of the colic, to excuse
my lying down upon your bed; hoping that when she heard of it,
her good nature would bring her to administer remedies for my
distemper.&nbsp; You know what might have followed.&nbsp; But,
like an uncivil person, you knocked at the door before your wife
was come to me.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; This is apocryphal; I may choose whether
I will believe it or no.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; That you may, faith, and I hope you won&rsquo;t
believe a word on&rsquo;t&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t help telling
the truth, for my life.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; How! would not you have me believe you, say
you?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; No; for then you must of consequence part with
your wife, and there will be some hopes of having her upon the
public; then the encouragement of a separate
maintenance&mdash;</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; No, no; for that matter, when she and I part,
she&rsquo;ll carry her separate maintenance about her.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Ah, cruel dear, how can you be so
barbarous?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll break my heart, if you talk of
parting.&nbsp; [<i>Cries</i>.]</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Ah, dissembling vermin!</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; How can&rsquo;st thou be so cruel, Isaac?&nbsp;
Thou hast the heart of a mountain-tiger.&nbsp; By the faith of a
sincere sinner, she&rsquo;s innocent for me.&nbsp; Go to him,
madam, fling your snowy arms about his stubborn neck; bathe his
relentless face in your salt trickling tears.&nbsp; [<i>She goes
and hangs upon his neck</i>, <i>and kisses him</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Bellmour</span> <i>kisses her hand behind</i> <span
class="smcap">Fondlewife&rsquo;s</span> <i>back</i>.]&nbsp; So, a
few soft words, and a kiss, and the good man melts.&nbsp; See how
kind nature works, and boils over in him.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Indeed, my dear, I was but just come down
stairs, when you knocked at the door; and the maid told me Mr.
Spintext was ill of the colic upon our bed.&nbsp; And won&rsquo;t
you speak to me, cruel Nykin?&nbsp; Indeed, I&rsquo;ll die, if
you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; No, no, I cannot speak, my heart&rsquo;s
so full&mdash;I have been a tender husband, a tender yoke-fellow;
you know I have.&mdash;But thou hast been a faithless Delilah,
and the Philistines&mdash;Heh!&nbsp; Art thou not vile and
unclean, heh?&nbsp; Speak.&nbsp; [<i>Weeping</i>.]</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; No-h.&nbsp; [<i>Sighing</i>.]</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Oh that I could believe thee!</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Oh, my heart will break.&nbsp; [<i>Seeming to
faint</i>.]</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Heh, how!&nbsp; No, stay, stay, I will believe
thee, I will.&nbsp; Pray bend her forward, sir.</p>
<p>L&AElig;T.&nbsp; Oh! oh!&nbsp; Where is my dear?</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Here, here; I do believe thee.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t
believe my own eyes.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; For my part, I am so charmed with the love of your
turtle to you, that I&rsquo;ll go and solicit matrimony with all
my might and main.</p>
<p>FOND.&nbsp; Well, well, sir; as long as I believe it,
&rsquo;tis well enough.&nbsp; No thanks to you, sir, for her
virtue.&mdash;But, I&rsquo;ll show you the way out of my house,
if you please.&nbsp; Come, my dear.&nbsp; Nay, I will believe
thee, I do, i&rsquo;feck.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; See the great blessing of an easy faith; opinion
cannot err.</p>
<p class="poetry">No husband, by his wife, can be deceived;<br />
She still is virtuous, if she&rsquo;s so believed.</p>

him fall into the snare, and unwittingly marry a whore.</p>

<p>SET.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Sharper</span>.]&nbsp; Sir, a word with you.&nbsp;
[<i>Whispers him</i>.]</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Sharper swears she has forsworn the
letter&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure he tells me truth;&mdash;but
I&rsquo;m not sure she told him truth: yet she was unaffectedly
concerned, he says, and often blushed with anger and surprise:
and so I remember in the park.&nbsp; She had reason, if I wrong
her.&nbsp; I begin to doubt.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Say&rsquo;st thou so?</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; This afternoon, sir, about an hour before my master
received the letter.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; In my conscience, like enough.</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; Ay, I know her, sir; at least, I&rsquo;m sure I can
fish it out of her: she&rsquo;s the very sluice to her
lady&rsquo;s secrets: &rsquo;tis but setting her mill agoing, and
I can drain her of &rsquo;em all.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Here, Frank, your bloodhound has made out the
fault: this letter, that so sticks in thy maw, is counterfeit;
only a trick of Sylvia in revenge, contrived by Lucy.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; It has a colour; but how do you know it,
sirrah?</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; I do suspect as much; because why, sir, she was
pumping me about how your worship&rsquo;s affairs stood towards
Madam Araminta; as, when you had seen her last? when you were to
see her next? and, where you were to be found at that time? and
such like.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; And where did you tell her?</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; In the Piazza.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; There I received the letter&mdash;it must be
so&mdash;and why did you not find me out, to tell me this before,
sot?</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; Sir, I was pimping for Mr. Bellmour.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; You were well employed: I think there is no
objection to the excuse.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Pox of my saucy credulity&mdash;if I have lost
her, I deserve it.&nbsp; But if confession and repentance be of
force, I&rsquo;ll win her, or weary her into a forgiveness.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Methinks I long to see Bellmour come forth.</p>

<p>SET.&nbsp; Talk of the devil: see where he comes.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Hugging himself in his prosperous
mischief&mdash;no real fanatic can look better pleased after a
successful sermon of sedition.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Sharper!&nbsp; Fortify thy spleen: such a
jest!&nbsp; Speak when thou art ready.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Now, were I ill-natured would I utterly
disappoint thy mirth: hear thee tell thy mighty jest with as much
gravity as a bishop hears venereal causes in the spiritual
court.&nbsp; Not so much as wrinkle my face with one smile; but
let thee look simply, and laugh by thyself.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Pshaw, no; I have a better opinion of thy
wit.&nbsp; Gad, I defy thee.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Were it not loss of time you should make the
experiment.&nbsp; But honest Setter, here, overheard you with
Lucy, and has told me all.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Nay, then, I thank thee for not putting me out of
countenance.&nbsp; But, to tell you something you don&rsquo;t
know.&nbsp; I got an opportunity after I had married &rsquo;em,
of discovering the cheat to Sylvia.&nbsp; She took it at first,
as another woman would the like disappointment; but my promise to
make her amends quickly with another husband somewhat pacified
her.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; But how the devil do you think to acquit yourself
of your promise?&nbsp; Will you marry her yourself?</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; I have no such intentions at present.&nbsp;
Prithee, wilt thou think a little for me?&nbsp; I am sure the
ingenious Mr. Setter will assist.</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; O Lord, sir!</p>

<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Hush, hush! don&rsquo;t you see him?</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Show him to me.&nbsp; Where is he?</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Nay, don&rsquo;t speak so loud.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t jest as I did a little while ago.&nbsp; Look
yonder!&nbsp; Agad, if he should hear the lion roar, he&rsquo;d
cudgel him into an ass, and his primitive braying.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you remember the story in &AElig;sop&rsquo;s Fables,
bully?&nbsp; Agad, there are good morals to be picked out of
&AElig;sop&rsquo;s Fables, let me tell you that, and Reynard the
Fox too.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Damn your morals.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Prithee, don&rsquo;t speak so loud.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Damn your morals; I must revenge the affront done
to my honour.&nbsp; [<i>In a low voice</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Ay; do, do, captain, if you think fitting.&nbsp;
You may dispose of your own flesh as you think fitting,
d&rsquo;ye see, but, by the Lord Harry, I&rsquo;ll leave
you.&nbsp; [<i>Stealing away upon his tip-toes</i>.]</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Prodigious!&nbsp; What, will you forsake your
friend in extremity?&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t in honour refuse to
carry him a challenge.&nbsp; [<i>Almost whispering</i>, <i>and
treading softly after him</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Prithee, what do you see in my face that looks
as if I would carry a challenge?&nbsp; Honour is your province,
captain; take it.&nbsp; All the world know me to be a knight, and
a man of worship.</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; I warrant you, sir, I&rsquo;m instructed.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Impossible!&nbsp; Araminta take a liking to a
fool?&nbsp; [<i>Aloud</i>.]</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; Her head runs on nothing else, nor she can talk of
nothing else.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; I know she commanded him all the while we were in
the Park; but I thought it had been only to make Vainlove
jealous.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; How&rsquo;s this!&nbsp; Good bully, hold your
breath and let&rsquo;s hearken.&nbsp; Agad, this must be I.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Death, it can&rsquo;t be.&nbsp; An oaf, an idiot,
a wittal.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Ay, now it&rsquo;s out; &rsquo;tis I, my own
individual person.</p>

<p>SHARP.&nbsp; She has given Vainlove her promise to marry him

all this evening, in order to conduct her to the place
appointed.</p>

do you press her to make all the haste imaginable.</p>

<p>SET.&nbsp; Were I a rogue now, what a noble prize could I
dispose of!&nbsp; A goodly pinnace, richly laden, and to launch
forth under my auspicious convoy.&nbsp; Twelve thousand pounds
and all her rigging, besides what lies concealed under
hatches.&nbsp; Ha! all this committed to my care!&nbsp; Avaunt,
temptation!&nbsp; Setter, show thyself a person of worth; be true
to thy trust, and be reputed honest.&nbsp; Reputed honest!&nbsp;
Hum: is that all?&nbsp; Ay; for to be honest is nothing; the
reputation of it is all.&nbsp; Reputation! what have such poor
rogues as I to do with reputation? &rsquo;tis above us; and for
men of quality, they are above it; so that reputation is even as
foolish a thing as honesty.&nbsp; And, for my part, if I meet Sir
Joseph with a purse of gold in his hand, I&rsquo;ll dispose of
mine to the best advantage.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Heh, heh, heh: Here &rsquo;tis for you,
i&rsquo;faith, Mr. Setter.&nbsp; Nay, I&rsquo;ll take you at your

undone!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m undone, my master&rsquo;s undone, my
lady&rsquo;s undone, and all the business is undone.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; No, no; never fear, man; the lady&rsquo;s
business shall be done.&nbsp; What, come, Mr. Setter, I have
overheard all, and to speak is but loss of time; but if there be
occasion, let these worthy gentlemen intercede for me.&nbsp;
[<i>Gives him gold</i>.]</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; O lord, sir, what d&rsquo;ye mean?&nbsp; Corrupt my
honesty?&nbsp; They have indeed very persuading faces.&nbsp;
But&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis too little, there&rsquo;s more,
man.&nbsp; There, take all.&nbsp; Now&mdash;</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; Well, Sir Joseph, you have such a winning way with
you&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; And how, and how, good Setter, did the little
rogue look when she talked of Sir Joseph?&nbsp; Did not her eyes
twinkle and her mouth water?&nbsp; Did not she pull up her little
bubbies?&nbsp; And&mdash;agad, I&rsquo;m so overjoyed&mdash;And
stroke down her belly? and then step aside to tie her garter when
she was thinking of her love?&nbsp; Heh, Setter!</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; Oh, yes, sir.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; How now, bully?&nbsp; What, melancholy because
I&rsquo;m in the lady&rsquo;s favour?&nbsp; No matter, I&rsquo;ll
make your peace: I know they were a little smart upon you.&nbsp;
But I warrant I&rsquo;ll bring you into the lady&rsquo;s good
graces.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Pshaw, I have petitions to show from other-guess
toys than she.&nbsp; Look here; these were sent me this
morning.&nbsp; There, read.&nbsp; [<i>Shows letters</i>].&nbsp;
That&mdash;that&rsquo;s a scrawl of quality.&nbsp; Here,
here&rsquo;s from a countess too.&nbsp; Hum&mdash;No,
hold&mdash;that&rsquo;s from a knight&rsquo;s wife&mdash;she sent
it me by her husband.&nbsp; But here, both these are from persons
of great quality.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; They are either from persons of great quality,
or no quality at all, &rsquo;tis such a damned ugly hand.&nbsp;
[<i>While</i> <span class="smcap">Sir Joseph</span> <i>reads</i>,
<span class="smcap">Bluffe</span> <i>whispers</i> <span

<p>SET.&nbsp; Captain, I would do anything to serve you; but this
is so difficult.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; Not at all.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t I know him?</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll remember the conditions?</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give it you under my hand.&nbsp; In
the meantime, here&rsquo;s earnest.&nbsp; [<i>Gives him

<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Pshaw, thou&rsquo;rt so troublesome and
inquisitive.&nbsp; My, I&rsquo;ll tell you; &rsquo;tis a young
creature that Vainlove debauched and has forsaken.&nbsp; Did you
never hear Bellmour chide him about Sylvia?</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Death, and hell, and marriage!&nbsp; My

achievements do deserve the epithet&mdash;Mercury was a pimp too,
but, though I blush to own it, at this time, I must confess I am
somewhat fallen from the dignity of my function, and do
condescend to be scandalously employed in the promotion of vulgar
matrimony.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; As how, dear, dexterous pimp?</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; Why, to be brief, for I have weighty affairs
depending&mdash;our stratagem succeeded as you

private conveyance of the lady to him, and put a shame-settlement
upon Sir Joseph.</p>

<p>ARAM.&nbsp; You who could reproach me with one counterfeit,
how insolent would a real pardon make you!&nbsp; But
there&rsquo;s no need to forgive what is not worth my anger.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; O&rsquo; my conscience, I could find in my heart
to marry thee, purely to be rid of thee&mdash;at least thou art
so troublesome a lover, there&rsquo;s hopes thou&rsquo;lt make a
more than ordinary quiet husband.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span

<p>BELL.&nbsp; Say you so?&nbsp; Is that a maxim among ye?</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Yes: you fluttering men of the <i>mode</i> have
made marriage a mere French dish.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; I hope there&rsquo;s no French sauce.&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; You are so curious in the preparation, that is,
your courtship, one would think you meant a noble
entertainment&mdash;but when we come to feed, &rsquo;tis all
froth, and poor, but in show.&nbsp; Nay, often, only remains,
which have been I know not how many times warmed for other
company, and at last served up cold to the wife.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; That were a miserable wretch indeed, who could not
afford one warm dish for the wife of his bosom.&nbsp; But you
timorous virgins form a dreadful chim&aelig;ra of a husband, as
of a creature contrary to that soft, humble, pliant, easy thing,
a lover; so guess at plagues in matrimony, in opposition to the
pleasures of courtship.&nbsp; Alas! courtship to marriage, is but
as the music in the play-house, until the curtain&rsquo;s drawn;
but that once up, then opens the scene of pleasure.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Oh, foh,&mdash;no: rather courtship to marriage,
as a very witty prologue to a very dull play.</p>

appear by the fair Araminta, my wife&rsquo;s permission.&nbsp;
Oh, the devil, cheated at last!&nbsp; [<span
class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>unmasks</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Only a little art-military trick, captain, only
countermined, or so.&nbsp; Mr. Vainlove, I suppose you know whom
I have got&mdash;now, but all&rsquo;s forgiven.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; I know whom you have not got; pray ladies convince
him.&nbsp; [<span class="smcap">Aram.</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Belin.</span> <i>unmask</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Ah! oh Lord, my heart aches.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp;
Setter, a rogue of all sides.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Sir Joseph, you had better have pre-engaged this
gentleman&rsquo;s pardon: for though Vainlove be so generous to
forgive the loss of his mistress, I know not how Heartwell may
take the loss of his wife.&nbsp; [<span
class="smcap">Sylvia</span> <i>unmasks</i>.]</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; My wife!&nbsp; By this light &rsquo;tis she, the
very cockatrice.&nbsp; O Sharper!&nbsp; Let me embrace
thee.&nbsp; But art thou sure she is really married to him?</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; Really and lawfully married, I am witness.</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Bellmour will unriddle to you.&nbsp; [<span
class="smcap">Heartwell</span> <i>goes to</i> <span
class="smcap">Bellmour</span>.]</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Pray, madam, who are you?&nbsp; For I find you
and I are like to be better acquainted.</p>
<p>SYLV.&nbsp; The worst of me is, that I am your wife&mdash;</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; Come, Sir Joseph, your fortune is not so bad as
you fear.&nbsp; A fine lady, and a lady of very good quality.</p>
<p>SIR JO.&nbsp; Thanks to my knighthood, she&rsquo;s a
lady&mdash;</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; That deserves a fool with a better title.&nbsp;
Pray use her as my relation, or you shall hear on&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; What, are you a woman of quality too, spouse?</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; And my relation; pray let her be respected
accordingly.&nbsp; Well, honest Lucy, fare thee well.&nbsp; I
think, you and I have been play-fellows off and on, any time this
seven years.</p>
<p>LUCY.&nbsp; Hold your prating.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m thinking what
vocation I shall follow while my spouse is planting laurels in
the wars.</p>
<p>BLUFF.&nbsp; No more wars, spouse, no more wars.&nbsp; While I
plant laurels for my head abroad, I may find the branches sprout
at home.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Bellmour, I approve thy mirth, and thank
thee.&nbsp; And I cannot in gratitude (for I see which way thou
art going) see thee fall into the same snare out of which thou
hast delivered me.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; I thank thee, George, for thy good intention; but
there is a fatality in marriage, for I find I&rsquo;m
resolute.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Then good counsel will be thrown away upon
you.&nbsp; For my part, I have once escaped; and when I wed
again, may she be&mdash;ugly, as an old bawd.</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; Ill-natured, as an old maid&mdash;</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Wanton, as a young widow&mdash;</p>
<p>SHARP.&nbsp; And jealous, as a barren wife.</p>
<p>HEART.&nbsp; Agreed.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Well; &rsquo;midst of these dreadful
denunciations, and notwithstanding the warning and example before
me, I commit myself to lasting durance.</p>
<p>BELIN.&nbsp; Prisoner, make much of your fetters.&nbsp;
[<i>Giving her hand</i>.]</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Frank, will you keep us in countenance?</p>
<p>VAIN.&nbsp; May I presume to hope so great a blessing?</p>
<p>ARAM.&nbsp; We had better take the advantage of a little of
our friend&rsquo;s experience first.</p>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; O&rsquo; my conscience she dares not consent, for
fear he should recant.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; Well, we shall
have your company to church in the morning.&nbsp; May be it may
get you an appetite to see us fall to before you.&nbsp; Setter,
did not you tell me?&mdash;</p>
<p>SET.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re at the door: I&rsquo;ll call
&rsquo;em in.</p>
<h3>A DANCE.</h3>
<p>BELL.&nbsp; Now set we forward on a journey for life.&nbsp;
Come take your fellow-travellers.&nbsp; Old George, I&rsquo;m
sorry to see thee still plod on alone.</p>
<p class="poetry">HEART.&nbsp; With gaudy plumes and jingling
bells made proud,<br />
The youthful beast sets forth, and neighs aloud.<br />
A morning-sun his tinselled harness gilds,<br />
And the first stage a down-hill greensward yields.<br />
But, oh&mdash;<br />
What rugged ways attend the noon of life!<br />
Our sun declines, and with what anxious strife,<br />
What pain we tug that galling load, a wife.<br />
All coursers the first heat with vigour run;<br />
But &rsquo;tis with whip and spur the race is won.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[<i>Exeunt Omnes</i>.]</p>
<h2>EPILOGUE.<br />
Spoken by <span class="smcap">Mrs. Barry</span>.</h2>
<p class="poetry">As a rash girl, who will all hazards run,<br />
And be enjoyed, though sure to be undone,<br />
Soon as her curiosity is over,<br />
Would give the world she could her toy recover,<br />
So fares it with our poet; and I&rsquo;m sent<br />
To tell you he already does repent:<br />
Would you were all as forward to keep Lent.<br />
Now the deed&rsquo;s done, the giddy thing has leisure<br />
To think o&rsquo; th&rsquo; sting, that&rsquo;s in the tail of
pleasure.<br />
Methinks I hear him in consideration:<br />
What will the world say?&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s my reputation?<br />
Now that&rsquo;s at stake.&nbsp; No, fool, &rsquo;tis out
o&rsquo; fashion.<br />
If loss of that should follow want of wit,<br />
How many undone men were in the pit!<br />
Why that&rsquo;s some comfort to an author&rsquo;s fears,<br />
If he&rsquo;s an ass, he will be tryed by&rsquo;s peers.<br />
But hold, I am exceeding my commission:<br />
My business here was humbly to petition;<br />
But we&rsquo;re so used to rail on these occasions,<br />
I could not help one trial of your patience:<br />
For &rsquo;tis our way, you know, for fear o&rsquo; th&rsquo;
worst,<br />
To be beforehand still, and cry Fool first.<br />
How say you, sparks?&nbsp; How do you stand affected?<br />
I swear, young Bays within is so dejected,<br />
&rsquo;Twould grieve your hearts to see him; shall I call him?<br
/>
But then you cruel critics would so maul him!<br />
Yet may be you&rsquo;ll encourage a beginner;<br />
But how?&nbsp; Just as the devil does a sinner.<br />
Women and wits are used e&rsquo;en much at one,<br />
You gain your end, and damn &rsquo;em when you&rsquo;ve done.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

cannot be read by your equipment.

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
